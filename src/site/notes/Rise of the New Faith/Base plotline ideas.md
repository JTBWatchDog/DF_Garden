# Arc 0 — Sinless Blood
$\quad$This arc follows the beginning of the Lamb's journey, starting with her execution. At this point in time, Nymeria is only a teen. She's revived some time after her execution, and manages to escape while her "corpse" is unattended. It's soon after that she meets Ratau, previous bearer of the crown, and is taken in by him.
$\quad$It's from Ratau that she begins to learn more about the Red Crown, and what is actually required of her with her new mission to begin a cult in Narinder's name. She also begins learning the rudimentary powers of the Crown. However, here's where the first problem is: Nymeria absolutely hates combat. More than that, following her execution and revival, she seems to have developed hemophobia. Both are bad qualities for a cult leader to have, and he has no idea how to resolve them—but it's still up to Ratau to shape her for the role she needs to fill. 
- Development of Ratau as a mentor figure, and eventually a father figure
- Introduce Flinky, Shrumy, and Klunko as other mentors
- Ratau tries to help Nymeria through her trauma over what happened, while simultaneously training her
- Ratau learns some of what happened to her & her parents during the Hunt
	- "The Hunt" is the Sheepfolk name for the Bishops war and genocide against them
