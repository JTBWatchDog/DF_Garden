This is a universal glossary for planets, systems, and any other galactic structure. 


## Tenno Kokoro-Kei

	The Tenno kokoro-kei, or Tenno Kokoro System, is home to four planets. Only one of them, Chikyuu, 1 AU from the star, is within the habitable zone of Tenno kao.
	The three others lay on the outerside of Tenno kaos habitable zone, those three being:
	- Akakyu-tei, a small red planet 1.43 AU away from its home star. It is a world defined by cold red sands, mostly covered in cold deserts. Those born under its sign are said to be blessed with patience.
	- Susano no me is a gas giant 2.21 AU away from its home star. It holds some cultural significance to the humans of Chikyuu, those born under its sign are said to be blessed with courage, but cursed with rashness.
