Truth by its nature is indescribable, though to explain it as simply as possible, it is the thread that weaves the world in which we live.

Truth is everpresent throughout the world, not restricted or bound to chakra, even found in the esoteric arts of alchemy, magicka, and divination.

Truth in its entirety is beyond any means of mortal comprehension.

To understand Truth fully would be to understand everything that is, and everything that is not.

To take on the role of lord of lords, god of gods; A divine creator.

Even a glimpse is enough to elevate a man to the heights of the gods.
