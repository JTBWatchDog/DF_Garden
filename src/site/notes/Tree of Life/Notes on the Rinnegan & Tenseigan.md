The Rinnegan is the Samsara Eye.

It is the eye that pierces the veil and sees beyond the cycle of death and rebirth.

While the Sharingan, the Mirror Eye, is related to Natural energy;

And the Byakugan, the White Eye, is related to Spiritual energy;

The Rinnegan is related to, and derived from, Truth.
Little is known about the Samsara Eye and how to obtain it, even to its wielders, but one theme runs true for each of them:

Each of them has died and looked upon the “Pure Lands”, before returning to the land of the living. Each of them has looked upon “Truth." [[Tree of Life/Notes on Truth\|Notes on Truth]]

Each of them has undergone a death and rebirth of the body, and surrendered themselves to "Truth."

The Tenseigan is considered to be the Reincarnation Eye, the counterpart and opposite of the Rinnegan. Both dojutsu are derived from "Truth" but are realized in opposite manners.

While the Rinnegan is obtained through a physical death and rebirth, the Tenseigan is achieved through an inner spiritual death, in which the former self is sacrificed completely.

In terms of their abilities, both the Rinnegan and Tenseigan grant their wielders access to unique and powerful types of chakra. However, while the Rinnegan grants abilities related to Truth and the cycle of life and death, the Tenseigan is focused on manipulation of chakra itself.

The Tenseigan allows its wielder to utilize four distinct types of chakra: Voracious, Obdurate, Adamantine, and Edacious. These chakra types are capable of consuming, repelling, suppressing, and draining chakra from other sources, respectively.

The realization of Truth through the Tenseigan is achieved by undergoing an inner death, in which the wielder sacrifices all of their longings and desires, leaving their former self behind.

This process allows the wielder to gain a deeper understanding of the universe and its inherent Truth. Through this realization, the wielder gains access to the Tenseigan's unique abilities and a heightened spiritual awareness.

The realization of the Tenseigan can have both positive and negative effects on the wielder. On one hand, the inner death required to achieve the Tenseigan can lead to a greater understanding of the universe and a more spiritual outlook on life. This can allow the wielder to approach problems and conflicts in a more peaceful and holistic manner, using their unique chakra abilities to bring balance to the world.

On the other hand, the realization of the Tenseigan can also lead to a dangerous sense of detachment from the physical world. The sacrifice of all longings and desires can leave the wielder feeling isolated and disconnected from others, potentially leading to a lack of empathy and understanding for those around them.

Additionally, the Tenseigan's unique chakra abilities can be used for destructive purposes if the wielder is not careful, leading to conflict and harm to others.

Overall, the Tenseigan is a powerful and unique dojutsu that allows its wielder to access four distinct types of chakra and gain a deeper understanding of the universe. However, the realization of the Tenseigan requires a great sacrifice, and its abilities must be used with care to avoid negative consequences.
