Standing at the top of the world, the Tree of Life is the root of all Chakra, guarded by nine Spirit clans. When the Tree and the clans were threatened by Otsutsuki Kaguya (whom had eaten of the tree), her two sons sought the aid of the two celestial spirits: Otsutsuki Hagoromo to the Sun Dragon of the east, and Otsutsuki Hamura to the Moon Dragon of the west. 

During this time, the nine spirit clans together held Kaguya back, warring against her to prevent her from utilizing the Trees full potential. 

And as the clans fought against her, some went out into the uttermost parts of the earth, raising their voice and crying: "Who is worthy to look upon the roots of the Tree of Life, to learn its secrets and know the tongue of its power, whose gaze has slain all who sought it?" 

Only one woman rose up to answer, the [[eldest daughter of Hagoromo\|eldest daughter of Hagoromo]], and said, 

"Here am I, your humble servent. I am worthy to look upon the Root, to learn its secrets and know its holy tongue. And if the Gaze of the Root shall take my life, then so be it. Here I am, teach me." 

For seven days and seven nights, without rest, the sole daughter of Hagoromo studied the Root of the Tree while the spirits warred against Kaguya. 

At the end of seven days, the daughter of Hagoromo went forth and, with the power of the Root and its Holy Script, sealed Kaguya in a tree for ninety days, until the return of Hagoromo and Hamura. 

With the teaching of the celestial dragons, the two sons of Kaguya used the Magick sealed in their hands to split Kaguya, the Sage of Ten Tails, into ten portions. 

And, taking those portions, sealed them into five disciples of Hamura, four disciples of Hagoromo, and the eldest heir of Hagoromo, his daughter.

These became the ten Tailed Beast Sages;

First disciple of Hagoromo, [[Moruya Kurama\|Moruya Kurama]], student of the Vulpine wolf clan, the Nine tailed Sage. Accompanying Hagoromo on his journey to meet the Sun dragon, Kurama was a woman orphaned by eastern raiders, whom Hagoromo saved from death; 

Then the second disciple of Hagoromo, [[Shukaku no Horokoya\|Shukaku no Horokoya]], student of the Tanuki clan, the Tanuki tailed Sage. 

The second to accompany his teacher on his journey, Shukaku was exiled from his home as a child, a victim of his own naivety, moved to do something unforgivable by one he trusted. 

Cast from his home, from the verge of death he was saved by his teacher.
