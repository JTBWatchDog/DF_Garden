> *. . . So let this be known by all Akeraan forevermore: When the calamity fell upon us, there was no aid from so-called "gods." No self-proclaimed deities stepped down from their lofty heights to save us, as our families were annihilated and our homes were burned and our lands were salted. 
> There was only us. 
> Knowing thus, consider your countrymen. Even if you know not their name, do not consider them a stranger nor look upon them with a strange eye— Rather, consider every man your brother, every woman your sister, every elder your father or mother and every youngling your child, as if they were your own blood; For they are your own blood! For our blood is one blood!
> Then let anyone who is able to help a so'ezil in need, and does not, be cursed as a Pactbreaker.*
Translated excerpt from the Akeraan epic *Durma Mai'im*, which many of the Akeraan people recant prior to every new year.

### An Introduction
The Akeraan can be described, mainly, as a militaristic and tightly knit people. 
All Akerr view each other as if they were blood related, leading to a sense of them being one large family. Those on the outside of that family, however, often find themselves... 'Disliked', to put it softly. 
Trust is hard to gain, and heavens forbid you break it. But once you're inside the family, you're *inside the family*, to put it simply. Flaky Akerr are surprisingly rare. This is, in part, due to the militaristic nature of their culture.

The society of the Akeraan is really a militaristic, tightly knit meritocracy. Social standing is dependent on, including but not limited to: 
- Ability in whatever profession they choose to pursue, whether they be a simple carpenter, or a scientist, or in the army.
- Combative ability, whether it be in strategy, or martial arts, or magic, or weapon mastery, as every able Akerr is expected to serve should the need rise. 
- Adherence to, but especially preservation of, tradition. Their reverence for their culture and traditions is profound, considering how close they came to losing it. Those that stray from it may be ostracized, or even outright punished depending on circumstance.
### A Quick History


##### Notable Figures

### The People
The Akeraan, as in the People and Nation simultaneously, is built on the foundation that every single person shares the same blood. The touch of this idea can be found *everywhere*, from their native tongue *Roknerua*, which holds many words such as *rengurra* (Literally "oathbreaker") and *so'ezil* (Literally "blood sibling", an affectionate term any Akerr can use to recognize another); To the structure of their government, their literature, and the list goes on.
This idea is only one of many remnants from their near-extinction at the hands of the Zulthanian Empire. 
It's thanks to this cultural foundation that the entire Akeraan people *is* like one large family — and, like any big, generation-spanning family, each of its members are about as different as they get.

##### Durza and the Black Crown
$\quad$Among the folklore of the Akerr, there is none so universal as Durza.

$\quad$Weird accounts began cropping up during the days of the Calamity, when the Zulthanian Empire forced the Akerr to flee for Dracoarx mons. Lone Akerr literally dead on their feet, surrounded by tens of dead Zulthanian soldiers; cowering civilians, turning and picking up a weapon before becoming a daemon of combat, slaying far more than they should be able; Akerr soldiers seemingly losing the ability to feel pain, one story telling of a soldier losing his entire lower jaw and continuing to fight on. 

$\quad$Among some of these is mentioned something known as the "black crown". Almost none elaborate on what this is, and to this day many argue on what it may have been. Some swear it was merely representative of something else (those argue on what it was representative *of*,) some swear it was a literal crown, some swear it never existed at all. 
Of all Akerr folklore the Black Crown is the *most* and *least* known about; everybody knows about it, but nobody knows what it actually is. 
$\quad$There are thousands of these tales at the least, with however many variations of each one. Of them all, the story which stands out the most is *the Woman of Vortha'a.*

$\quad$The story generally goes, early in the days of Calamity, the Empire attacked the city of Vortha'a, on Akeraan's border.
