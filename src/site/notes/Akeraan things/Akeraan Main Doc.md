> *. . . So let this be known by all Akeraan forevermore: When the calamity fell upon us, there was no aid from so-called "gods." No self-proclaimed deities stepped down from their lofty heights to save us, as our families were annihilated and our homes were burned and our lands were salted. 
> There was only us. 
> Knowing thus, consider your countrymen. Even if you know not their name, do not consider them a stranger nor look upon them with a strange eyeâ€” Rather, consider every man your brother, every woman your sister, every elder your father or mother and every youngling your child, as if they were your own blood; For they are your own blood! For our blood is one blood!
> Then let anyone who is able to help a so'ezil in need, and does not, be cursed as a Pactbreaker.*
Translated excerpt from the Akeraan epic *Durma Mai'im*, which many of the Akeraan people recant prior to every new year.

### An Introduction
The Akeraan can be described, mainly, as a militaristic and tightly knit people. 
All Akerr view each other as if they were blood related, leading to a sense of them being one large family. Those on the outside of that family, however, often find themselves... 'Disliked', to put it softly. 
Trust is hard to gain, and heavens forbid you break it. But once you're inside the family, you're *inside the family*, to put it simply. Flaky Akerr are surprisingly rare. This is, in part, due to the militaristic nature of their culture.

The society of the Akeraan is really a militaristic, tightly knit meritocracy. Social standing is dependent on, including but not limited to: 
- Ability in whatever profession they choose to pursue, whether they be a simple carpenter, or a scientist, or in the army.
- Combative ability, whether it be in strategy, or martial arts, or magic, or weapon mastery, as every able Akerr is expected to serve should the need rise. 
- 

That militaristic nature is in large part an effect of the *Co'arradur* or "Calamity", in reference to their near-extinction at the hand of the Zulthanian Empire.

### The People
The Akeraan, as in the People and Nation simultaneously, is built on the foundation that every single person shares the same blood. The touch of this idea can be found *everywhere*, from their native tongue *Roknerua*, which holds many words such as *rengurra* (Literally "oathbreaker") and *so'ezil* (Literally "blood sibling", an affectionate term any Akerr can use to recognize another); To the structure of their government, their literature, and the list goes on.
This idea is only one of many remnants from their near-extinction at the hands of the Zulthanian Empire. 
It's thanks to this cultural foundation that the entire Akeraan people *is* like one large family. 

But for those on the *outside* of that family, getting 'in' can be... *Difficult*. 
Trust is hard to gain, and the breakage of that trust is not easily forgotten.
