> *. . . So let this be known by all Akeraan forevermore: When the calamity fell upon us, there was no aid from so-called "gods." No self-proclaimed deities stepped down from their lofty heights to save us, as our families were annihilated and our homes were burned and our lands were salted. 
> There was only us. 
> Knowing thus, consider your countrymen. Even if you know not their name, do not consider them a stranger nor look upon them with a strange eyeâ€” Rather, consider every man your brother, every woman your sister, every elder your father or mother and every youngling your child, as if they were your own blood; For they are your own blood! For our blood is one blood!
> Then let anyone who is able to help a blood-sibling in need, and does not, be cursed as a Pactbreaker.*
Translated excerpt from the Akeraan epic *Durma Mai'im*, which is recited by the Akeraan people prior to every new year.
