> *. . . So let this be known by all Akeraan forevermore: When the calamity fell upon us, there was no aid from so-called "gods." No self-proclaimed deities stepped down from their lofty heights to save us, as our families were annihilated and our homes were burned and our lands were salted. 
> There was only us. 
> Knowing thus, consider your countrymen. Even if you know not their name, do not consider them a stranger nor look upon them with a strange eyeâ€” Rather, consider every man your brother, every woman your sister, every elder your father or mother and every youngling your child, as if they were your own blood; For they are your own blood! For our blood is one blood!
> Then let anyone who is able to help a so'ezil in need, and does not, be cursed as a Pactbreaker.*
Translated excerpt from the Akeraan epic *Durma Mai'im*, which many of the Akeraan people recant prior to every new year.

### An Introduction
The Akeraan, as in the People and Nation simultaneously, is built on the foundation that every single person shares the same blood. The touch of this idea can be found *everywhere*, from their native tongue *Roknerua*, which holds many words such as *rengurra* (Literally "oathbreaker") and *so'ezil* (Literally "blood sibling", an affectionate term any Akerr can use to recognize another); To the structure of their government, their culture, and the list goes on.
This idea is only one of many remnants from their near-extinction at the hands of the Zulthanian Empire.
