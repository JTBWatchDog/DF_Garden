While one of many peoples displaced by the efforts of the Zulthanian Empire, the Akeraan are likely the most radically changed by it. While their history will not be fully extrapolated on here, in summary: They were absorbed into the Empire, but when asked to attack another group they were allied with prior to their absorption, they were unable to do so.  
Inevitably, the Empire turned on them.  
Thanks to many key members, the noble sacrifice of many soldiers, and their willpower, the majority of their populace was saved. They hid and sealed themselves within the heart of a mountain on the west coast of Eiyora, which would later come to be known as Dracoarx Mons, completely vanishing from the sight of the Empire. The Empire would never find them again.  
This event came to be known simply as “The Calamity”, or “Krymorax” in their tongue.

In the present day, the Akeraan is a mostly neutral state in the grand scheme of things. So long as your name doesn’t include “Zulth”, if you stay off of their-and their allies-toes then they’ll stay off of yours. 
Entirely secular, highly family-oriented, intoxicatingly patriotic, and militaristic to the extreme, the Akeraan are a tightly-knit group. Their loyalty to their people and their devotion to their “Omnattan”, or “Allfather” Abias Theou, is likely only second to the utterly deranged (and, debatably, the Hashinese.)  
As far as economics goes, the Akeraan and their allies* likely possess one of the largest-spanning railway systems on the continent, if not period, spanning much of western Eiyora. (*Really, the Akeraan are the ones in control of it.) Their understanding of Metallurgy and Metalworking is also highly advanced.  
However unknown to the world, in the modern age their true prowess flourishes: Subterfuge. Be it through sleeper agents, hidden deep, acting as an early warning system in the face of aggression; Or more traditional agents, actively collecting in the field; Or, their latest addition to their ranks, their experts in cyber warfare and recon; Their reach—while never particularly deep, due to the presence of mind magic—is vast.  
An Akeraan agent has never been caught alive.
