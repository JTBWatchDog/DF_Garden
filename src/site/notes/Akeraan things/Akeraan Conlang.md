## Phonotactics rules
1. Word structure is (C)(C)(V)(ʔ)V(C)(C)
2. ʔ must be between vowels
3. Onset: Everything except /l/
4. Nucleus: All vowels, /R/
5. Coda: Everything 
6. ʔ never clusters
7. In consonant clusters:
	- A sonorant can only be paired with an obstruent and vice versa
	- Consonant onsets started by Nasals can only be followed by another non-nasal sonorant
8. A consonant must not be followed by a voiced stop or voiced fricative
