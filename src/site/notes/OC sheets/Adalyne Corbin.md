| Adalyne Corbin | 86<br>(Born 641 AE) |  F  |     A     | Dorraul Kobold<br>(Viara Du'ul clan) |

Name: Adalyne Corbin 
Age: 86
Sex: Female
Species: Dorraul Kobold (Viara Du'ul clan)
Mage rank: A

### Appearance 
Scale/skin color: Silver body, gray bi-color across her face, the front of her torso, and the underside of her tail.

Hair color: Blond/Pale gold 
Hair style:
$\quad$Texture and styling is extremely similar to a lion’s mane, growing not only over the top of her head but also over the back of her neck and around her collarbone. 
$\quad$After Absalems death (and her becoming a widow,) in the custom of the Viara Du'ul clan, she shaved all of her previous hair off and began growing her dreadlocks once more, in the fashion of the clans warriors. 

Eye Color: Amber/Gold-ish brown
Weight: 198 lb. / 90 kg.
Height: 6'5" / 195 cm
##### Physical description
$\quad$Adalynes form is the result of 17 years of ceaseless, fervid training. Her adherence to her diet, her commitment to the evolution of her magic, and her devotion to the cultivation of her fighting ability can only be described as zealous and frenzied. 
$\quad$Her body reflects this, in every aspect. 
$\quad$She looks like a woman who has picked heavy things up, put them down again, and then done that a few tens of billions of times over the past 17 or so years.

$\quad$Adalyne possesses a large pair of ram-esque horns, made of a dark gray type of keratin. The tip of her right horn is broken off. This was purposeful and self-inflicted:
$\quad$It is the custom of the Viara Du'ul clan, that any who become a widow do such to themselves— This breaks the marital ring inserted into the horn during the wedding ceremony. 
$\quad$This is the only case in which it can be removed, as the ring is heated and welded shut after being placed. A Viara Du'ul kobold with a broken horn will never re-marry, and will remain a widow for life.
### Info

Personality: 
$\quad$Adalyne contains a broiling and seething wrath within her that burns at her gut, eternal. Threatening to consume her, and everyone around her, it is only held captive by adamantine command over herself. Yet still it burns, unquenchable. 
$\quad$Even so, she gives her utmost to not let her wrath control nor define her soul. No matter how she might feel to be curt, or brusque, or even tactless. No matter her impatience. No matter the silence of her home, where once was so much joy. No matter how difficult it is to control that anger, when it feels she's being flayed from within, and make that decision to be kind.
$\quad$But the devil yet festers in still water.

Likes/Dislikes:
$\quad$She enjoys meditation and the art of making tea, but cannot stand to hear silence for any considerable length of time. Say anything negative about her daughters and she'll break your face.
#### Backstory

> [!EXAMPLE]- Childhood to Pre-Dragonfall (OPTIONAL)
> $\quad$The aging kobolds life is one that can best be described as "tumultuous." 
$\quad$Her home life, during her childhood, was adequate — for a time. Until she learned her version of "adequate" was *very* different from others. Until she told father what mother had done to her. Until she woke up one night to the sound of her father, Dolais, screaming at her mother, Urmin.
$\quad$Until Adalyne heard that, if she ever so much as looked at Adalyne again, he'd kill her. Mother left that night. 
$\quad$That following morning, when the sun was rising, Adalyne woke up to a bunch of noise outside: Mother had come back with five of her friends, and they were all standing together. Then Adalyne saw father on the ground, in the middle of them. She never really could remember anything past that point, except for hearing the sound of her own heartbeat and seeing red. 
$\quad$She killed mother that day, and all five of mothers friends. She had been fifteen.
>$\quad$
>$\quad$
>$\quad$Quantifying with words alone the depth to which this event, and everything leading up to it, affected Adalyne is difficult. "Impossible" may be an apt word. The misandry of the Viara Du'ul clan (and several others,) like a late-stage infection, is deep and wide spread — And throughout her adolescence, every single rearing of its ugly head made Adalynes blood boil. 
>$\quad$That rage, instead of disappearing like several of her relatives hoped, persisted. It fermented. A punk (the closest Acurian equivalent, anyway) through school, and later her arcane tutelage, Adalyne was like a magnet to likeminded clanmates. Without any effort, they flocked to her. 
>$\quad$Her anger and her bullheaded refusal to be quiet were polarizing; Combined with her prodigal skill in combat, including tactics both technical and martial, one could say she was destined to climb the ranks of *Dorma Zaul's* (the home citystate of Viara Du'ul and several likeminded clans) meritocracy. 
>$\quad$And she did. 
>$\quad$What teachers once believed was only "prodigal" skill quickly revealed itself to be so much more, when Adalyne joined into the 'wargames' hosted between *Dorma Zaul*, its factions, and the factions of neighboring regions. 
><ul><small> Author's note: These wargames are exactly what they sound like: Standardized combat designed to settle disputes between several notoriously squabbly factions and regions, developed to make sure they weren't annihilated by a (then) recently formed United Mainland federation> </small></ul>
>
>$\quad$Throughout her 20s and 30s the climb she made up the ranks was meteoric, as victory after victory—small and large, personal and on the battlefield—piled up at her feet like so much chaff. And gradually, she found more and more people like her. And, eventually, Adalyne woke up to find a miniature movement had built up around her. 
>$\quad$Now, the wargames weren't *just* a job that she both enjoyed doing and *happened* to be very good at—Every game she won became another statement. Now, an off-hand comment was no longer *just* an off-hand comment—Everything she said now seemed to spread through the grapevine.
>$\quad$By her late 30s she had people asking her when she was going to challenge the position of Shul Rosen — And she hadn't known that she was, apparently, planning to.
>
>$\quad$Adalyne still can't remember what she felt at 45, when she defeated the previous Shul Rosen in a final trial of martial combat. Perhaps because she didn't feel anything. 
>$\quad$However, regardless of the adamancy of the movement she now found herself the spearhead for, there was one issue that they had forgotten about: Her ability to politick; Or, more accurately, her lack thereof. 
>$\quad$For the small yet fervent group that had centered themselves around her, this was the one obstacle that she—and by extension *they*—could not get around. Adalyne could not sway the minds of the elders, nor the minds of the people at large, when push came to shove. 
>$\quad$And so it would remain.
>$\quad$
>$\quad$
>$\quad$It's hard for Adalyne to say when, or why, she really took up that quest for change. After the attempt on her husband's life, perhaps; Or the attempt on her father's life, before that. But, she remembers very vividly the day she "woke up."
>$\quad$The day she realized that none of it meant anything to her. Not the movement behind her, not the title of Shul Rosen, not even the prospect of change in the clan. None of it mattered to her, not at all.
>$\quad$Adalyne had followed this quest for change, filled the role other people had prepared for her, because the people she cared about had been harmed by an unjust system. But, blindsided by the people that surrounded her, she'd never realized there had been a simpler option:
>$\quad$There's a large, large world out there. Outside these old stone walls and their old, carcinogenic ways. 
>$\quad$She could have left. Her, and her family—They'd never been rich (prior to her political ascension and the opportunities it offered her,) but a move had never been possible. 
>$\quad$And so she did. With her husband, and her child barely a month in the womb, they left for Dragonfall.



> [!EXAMPLE]+ Post-Dragonfall (THE ACTUAL NEW STUFF)
>$\quad$Once upon a time, Adalyne and her family were at peace. Perhaps not everything was perfect, but they were happy. They had moved to Dragonfall in 690, while Adalyne was two months pregnant with Blaise. In contrast to Absalem, who had worked as a mage hunter[^1] and thus had traveled plenty, this was Adalynes first time being outside of Dorma Zaul for any significant period. 
>$\quad$Despite her efforts in learning Yexvian, acclimating would prove to be far more difficult for her than for her husband — regardless, she got it eventually. That was a good few hectic months of their life: Between moving in, acclimating to the change in not just language but also culture, and Adalynes pregnancy, this was one of the most stressful periods of her life — Even including the previous assassination attempts on her husband and father.
>$\quad$Yet in other ways, it was also one of the least stressful. Even to the present day, it's difficult to explain. Perhaps the best way to explain it is that this new stress, despite being no lesser or greater than that previous stress, was *smaller* in scale. Or perhaps there is no good way to explain it. Perhaps it doesn't matter.
>$\quad$
>$\quad$What does matter is that one day, Adalyne woke up. She had a home, not just a place she lived but a *home*, untouched by shadows of the past; she had a husband, who no longer *needed* to carry a weapon with him at all hours, who no longer needed to be forever *vigilant* even within his own home; she had a beautiful baby boy, who would never know the dreadful darkness within those old stone walls.
>$\quad$And for the first time, it felt... real. That shadow no longer hovered over her. And for the first time in a long time, she knew peace.
>$\quad$How she wishes it could have lasted, but some things are not meant to be.
>$\quad$
>$\quad$
>$\quad$It happened in 709 AE, in Blaise's first year at DFMA when he was 18. The thrice-damned image is etched onto her mind, preserved forevermore. The cold blood pooling. It was supposed to be a day for joy. A day for celebration of new life. 
>$\quad$Mother and child came home to a mess of broken furniture and torn flesh.
>$\quad$
>$\quad$Those days were the worst of her life.
>$\quad$Were it not that Blaise, and the little one within her womb, needed her, Adalyne would not have survived those weeks. She almost didn't anyway. Most of those days she has no memory of, except for the last day of that depressive episode. It had been three weeks, and a half perhaps. She hadn't left her bed for close to two days. She hadn't showered in even longer. 
>Adalyne didn't remember the last time she had eaten. Perhaps a week ago.
>$\quad$It was her child that finally pulled her out of it. What a mother she was.
>Adalyne can still remember when Blaise woke her, begging her to get up and eat. He had cooked for her. He didn't leave her alone until she'd eaten it all. She can't remember when she fell asleep again, holding onto him for dear life. Nor can she remember how many times she apologized to him. 
>$\quad$
>$\quad$Blaise made her promise something that following day. He made her promise that, even in her grief, she would not lose her will to live. Absalem would not want it; so she got up. She shaved her head, her neck, and her collarbone. Taking a hammer and an awl, Adalyne broke her right horn where the marital ring was embedded and let it bleed, allowing the scar to set. She did not let that darkness consume her again.
>$\quad$Perhaps in time she would have moved on properly, and continued to live in spite of this pain. Fate, however, had different plans for her.
>$\quad$
>$\quad$
>$\quad$Adalyne and Blaise were shopping together when they encountered an odd kobold. She can still remember him vividly. He struck a wrong chord in her, but she couldn't explain why at the time.
>$\quad$While she was trying to exit conversation with the odd fellow, he said something that stopped her. 
>>"Doesn't it bother you?" He had asked Adalyne. When asked what he was talking about, the odd man went on and said, 
>>"That I killed your husband."
>$\quad$
>$\quad$Surprisingly enough, as stunned as she was it wasn't Adalyne that attacked him first; it was Blaise. It happened so fast, and (what Adalyne now knew was) the demon didn't even use magic. One moment Blaise was attacking with a blade of wind, and then her arm was broken. (Several weeks prior to this, Blaise had come out as trans, to Adalyne's nonexistent surprise.) As easy as a snake lies, the demon put her out of the fight. 
>$\quad$Between the devils abilities scaling evenly to Adalyne's own, and having to defend Blaise on top of that, it was a hard fight. Were it not for her child's genius and sacrifice, she would have lost. 
>$\quad$
>$\quad$As Adalyne faced off against the devil, Blaise focused all of has magic into an infinitesimal point in his left hand. When he reached the end of his reserves, he committed all the power of his tattoos, leaving them a dull black. Perhaps that would have been enough, but he didn't stop there. He dug deeper.
>$\quad$In his rage he dug so deep, searching for every spare scrap of mana, that he began sacrificing the mass of his body. First the fat, then the muscle when that was depleted. Blaise atrophied before their very eyes. [[Flashbacks/Flashback scenes\|What happened next is beyond summarization.]]
