| 6'5<br>195 cm | 198 lb<br>90 kg | Blonde gold | Golden Amber | Silver body<br>Gray bi-color across face,<br>front of torso, and underside<br>of tail |
 
 Hair style:
$\quad$Texture and styling is extremely similar to a lion’s mane, growing not only over the top of her head but also over the back of her neck and around her collarbone. 
$\quad$After Absalems death (and her becoming a widow,) in the custom of the Viara Du'ul clan, she shaved all of her previous hair off and began growing her dreadlocks once more, in the fashion of the clans warriors. 

##### Physical description
$\quad$Adalynes form is the result of 17 years of ceaseless, fervid training. Her adherence to her diet, her commitment to the evolution of her magic, and her devotion to the cultivation of her fighting ability can only be described as zealous and frenzied. 
$\quad$Her body reflects this, in every aspect. 
$\quad$She looks like a woman who has picked heavy things up, put them down again, and then done that a few tens of billions of times over the past 17 or so years.

$\quad$Adalyne possesses a large pair of ram-esque horns, made of a dark gray type of keratin. The tip of her right horn is broken off. This was purposeful and self-inflicted:
$\quad$It is the custom of the Viara Du'ul clan, that any who become a widow do such to themselves— This breaks the marital ring inserted into the horn during the wedding ceremony. 
$\quad$This is the only case in which it can be removed, as the ring is heated and welded shut after being placed. A Viara Du'ul kobold with a broken horn will never re-marry, and will remain a widow for life.
### Info

Personality: 
$\quad$Adalyne contains a broiling and seething wrath within her that burns at her gut, eternal. Threatening to consume her, and everyone around her, it is only held captive by adamantine command over herself. Yet still it burns, unquenchable. 
$\quad$Even so, she gives her utmost to not let her wrath control nor define her soul. No matter how she might feel to be curt, or brusque, or even tactless. No matter her impatience. No matter the silence of her home, where once was so much joy. No matter how difficult it is to control that anger, when it feels she's being flayed from within, and make that decision to be kind.
$\quad$But the devil yet festers in still water.

Likes/Dislikes:
$\quad$She enjoys meditation and the art of making tea, but cannot stand to hear silence for any considerable length of time. Say anything negative about her daughters and she'll break your face.
#### Backstory

> [!EXAMPLE]- Childhood to Pre-Dragonfall (OPTIONAL)
> $\quad$The aging kobolds life is one that can best be described as "tumultuous." 
$\quad$Her home life, during her childhood, was adequate — for a time. Until she learned her version of "adequate" was *very* different from others. Until she told father what mother had done to her. Until she woke up one night to the sound of her father, Dolais, screaming at her mother, Urmin.
$\quad$Until Adalyne heard that, if she ever so much as looked at Adalyne again, he'd kill her. Mother left that night. 
$\quad$That following morning, when the sun was rising, Adalyne woke up to a bunch of noise outside: Mother had come back with five of her friends, and they were all standing together. Then Adalyne saw father on the ground, in the middle of them. She never really could remember anything past that point, except for hearing the sound of her own heartbeat and seeing red. 
$\quad$She killed mother that day, and all five of mothers friends. She had been fifteen.
>$\quad$
>$\quad$
>$\quad$Quantifying with words alone the depth to which this event, and everything leading up to it, affected Adalyne is difficult. "Impossible" may be an apt word. The misandry of the Viara Du'ul clan (and several others,) like a late-stage infection, is deep and wide spread — And throughout her adolescence, every single rearing of its ugly head made Adalynes blood boil. 
>$\quad$That rage, instead of disappearing like several of her relatives hoped, persisted. It fermented. A punk (the closest Acurian equivalent, anyway) through school, and later her arcane tutelage, Adalyne was like a magnet to likeminded clanmates. Without any effort, they flocked to her. 
>$\quad$Her anger and her bullheaded refusal to be quiet were polarizing; Combined with her prodigal skill in combat, one could say she was destined to climb the ranks of *Dorma Zaul's* (the home citystate of Viara Du'ul and several likeminded clans) meritocracy. 
>$\quad$And she did. 
>$\quad$What teachers once believed was only "prodigal" skill quickly revealed itself to be so much more, when Adalyne joined into the 'wargames' hosted between *Dorma Zaul*, its factions, and the factions of neighboring regions.[^1]
>
>$\quad$Throughout her 20s and 30s the climb she made up the ranks was meteoric, as victory after victory piled up at her feet like so much chaff. And gradually, she found more and more people like her. And, eventually, Adalyne woke up to find a miniature movement had built up around her. 
>$\quad$Now, the wargames weren't *just* a job that she both enjoyed doing and *happened* to be very good at—Every game she won became another statement. Now, an off-hand comment was no longer *just* an off-hand comment—Everything she said now seemed to spread through the grapevine.
>$\quad$By her late 30s she had people asking her when she was going to challenge the position of Shul Rosen — And she hadn't known that she was, apparently, planning to.
>
>$\quad$Adalyne still can't remember what she felt at 45, when she defeated the previous Shul Rosen in a final trial of martial combat. Perhaps because she didn't feel anything. 
>$\quad$However, regardless of the adamancy of the movement she now found herself the spearhead for, there was one issue that they had forgotten about: Her ability to politick; Or, more accurately, her lack thereof. 
>For the small yet fervent group that had centered themselves around her, this was the one obstacle that she—and by extension *they*—could not get around. Adalyne could not sway the minds of the elders, nor the minds of the people at large, when push came to shove. 
>$\quad$And so it would remain.
>$\quad$
>$\quad$
>$\quad$It's hard for Adalyne to say when, or why, she really took up that quest. After the attempt on her husband's life, perhaps; Or the attempt on her father's life, before that. But, she remembers very vividly the day she "woke up."
>The day she realized that none of it meant anything to her. Not the movement behind her, not the title, not even the prospect of change in the clan. None of it mattered to her, not at all.
>$\quad$Adalyne had followed this quest for change, filled the role other people had prepared for her, because the people she cared about had been harmed by an unjust system. But, blindsided by the people that surrounded her, she'd never realized there had been a simpler option:
>There's a large, large world out there. Outside these old stone walls and their old, carcinogenic ways. 
>$\quad$She could have left. Her, and her family—They'd never been rich (prior to her political ascension and the opportunities it offered her,) but a move had never been impossible. 
>And so she did. With her husband, and her child barely a month in the womb, they left for Dragonfall.



> [!EXAMPLE]+ Post-Dragonfall (THE ACTUAL NEW STUFF)
>$\quad$Once upon a time, Adalyne and her family were at peace. They had moved in 690, while Adalyne was two months pregnant with Blaise. In contrast to Absalem, who had who had traveled plenty as a mage hunter[^2], this was Adalynes first time being outside of Dorma Zaul for any significant period. 
>$\quad$Despite her efforts, acclimating would prove to be far more difficult for her than for her husband — regardless, she got it eventually. That was a good few hectic months of their life: Between moving in, acclimating to the change in not just language but also culture, and Adalynes pregnancy, this was one of the most stressful periods of her life — Even including the previous assassination attempts on her husband and father.
>Yet in other ways, it was also the least stressful. Even to the present day, it's difficult to explain. Perhaps it doesn't matter.
>$\quad$
>$\quad$What does matter is that one day, Adalyne woke up. She had not just a place she lived but a *home*, untouched by shadows of the past; she had a husband, who no longer *needed* to carry a weapon at all hours, no longer needed to be forever *vigilant*; she had a beautiful baby boy, who would never know the dreadful darkness within those old stone walls.
>And for the first time, it felt... real. That shadow no longer hovered over her. And for the first time in a long time, she knew peace.
>$\quad$How she wishes it could have lasted.
>$\quad$
>$\quad$
>$\quad$It happened in 709 AE, in Blaise's first year at DFMA when he was 18. The cold blood pooling. It was supposed to be a day for celebration of new life. Absalem's birthday was four days away.
>$\quad$Mother and child came home to a mess of broken furniture and torn flesh.
>$\quad$
>$\quad$Those days were the worst of her life.
>Were it not that Blaise, and the little one within her womb, needed her, Adalyne would not have survived those weeks. Most of those days she has no memory of, except for the last day of that depressive episode. Three weeks, perhaps. She hadn't left her bed for close to two days. She hadn't showered in even longer. 
>Adalyne didn't remember the last time she had eaten. Perhaps a week ago.
>
>$\quad$It was her child that finally pulled her out of it. What a mother she was.
>Adalyne can still remember when Blaise woke her, begging her to get up and eat. He had cooked for her. He didn't leave her alone until she'd eaten it all. She can't remember when she fell asleep again, holding onto him for dear life. Nor can she remember how many times she apologized to him. 
>$\quad$
>$\quad$Blaise made her promise something that following day. He made her promise that, even in her grief, she would not lose her will to live. Absalem would not want it; so she got up. She shaved her head, her neck, and her collarbone. Taking hammer and awl, Adalyne broke her right horn where the marital ring was embedded and let it bleed, allowing the scar to set. She did not let that darkness consume her again.
>$\quad$Perhaps in time she would have moved on properly, and continued to live in spite of this pain. Fate, however, had different plans for her.
>$\quad$
>$\quad$
>$\quad$Adalyne and Blaise were shopping together when they encountered an odd kobold. She can still remember him vividly. He struck a wrong chord in her, but she couldn't explain why at the time.
>$\quad$While she was trying to exit the conversation the odd fellow forced upon them, he said something that stopped her. 
>>"Doesn't it bother you?" He had asked Adalyne. When asked what he was talking about, the odd man went on and said, 
>>"That I killed your husband."
> 
>$\quad$
>$\quad$Blaise was the first to attack. In a single viperous movement, the devil redirected her attack and broke her dominant arm; Blaise was taken out of the fight, while Adalyne was too stunned to react. Worse than this, Adalyne now had to defend her whilst contending with the devil whose abilities scaled to her own. From the first exchange, the battle was lost.
>Or so Adalyne thought.
>$\quad$Whilst her mother contended with the demon, Blaise was not idle. She decided she was going to use everything. Every scrap of mana she had access to, including the energy contained within her *markana.* And then she went deeper, converting the mass of her body into energy. Blaise began to atrophy before their eyes.
>[[Flashbacks/Flashback scenes\|What happened next is almost beyond Adalyne's Ability to describe.]]
>$\quad$When the smoke cleared, the devil's dominant arm had been obliterated up to the shoulder. Part of the scorched, blackened humerus bone were visible. The devil was down, but not dead nor defeated. 
>Taking her daughter, Adalyne fled.
>$\quad$
>$\quad$Blaise was held in the ICU for three weeks. Every bone in her left arm had been reduced to shards, and had to be regrown from scratch; in addition to this, she had lost ~27% of her body weight. And Adalyne...
>Seeing her daughter through the window of the door, connected to wires upon wires and tubes upon tubes, standing at the door of death. . . Words could not then, and cannot now, suffice. 
>Adalyne returned home in a thick, red haze.
>$\quad$
>$\quad$Decades as a prodigy in combat of many forms, despite her rust, had not been lost to Adalyne. This whirlwind of fear, rage, sorrow, and so many other emotions was something she could deal with in spite of how it threatened to drown her. She had dealt with it before. She would deal with it again.
>$\quad$For much of those three weeks, Adalyne did little more than eat, sleep, and meditate. Day after day, she spent parsing her thoughts and emotions. Fear, dread, sorrow, and so much chaff was cast aside. All that remained was absolute wrath and absolute determination. 
>$\quad$Adalyne found the conclusion she needed: This devil had taken her husband from her, and now it had almost taken her child. 
>There was only one path that would not lead to her own self-destruction.
>The devil would die at her hand, or she would die at his. 






### Magic Name: Wrath of The World
OC Using this magic: Adalyne Corbin
Overall place in type triad: Offensive
**Elemental Properties** 
Strength(Earth), Speed(Water), Might(Lightning)
> [!EXAMPLE]- Racial Perk: Dorraul Markana
>$\quad$Adalyne's arcane tattoos. Kobold magi of several specific species can be born with them. They are a direct interface between magic and biology, growing with a mage as they age and develop. These markings have a metallic appearance.
>
>$\quad$Adalyne has exceedingly large markana, covering extensive portions of her arms, legs, and collarbone. The markings on her arms consist of red spirals with black outlines, with a white cross on the outside of her right forearm; on her legs, interwoven emerald green bands with black outlines. The last, on her collarbone, is defined by thin flowing blue bands that meet at her sternum; in the middle of them, over her sternum, there is a small portion of Adalyne's flesh that has crystallized.
>$\quad$This interfacing of biology with her Conceptual Elements has led to the creation of Boris and Ilja, which are manifestations of her Strength and Speed elements respectively. They are summons directly bound to the markana on her arms and legs. Summoning them prevents her from using their respective element entirely until they return to her and join back again to their respective tattoo, which effectively act as their housing. 
#### Description
Over time, Adalyne "lost" her Psychic affinity; or perhaps rather, what was once a Psychic affinity matured into a Lightning affinity as she exited retirement. Regardless, in addition to clearing her rust & re-establishing control over her base elements, Adalyne possesses control over Lightning.

$\quad$Now, much of her magic revolves around her elemental cloaks. By a specific encoding technique, she has instilled the essence of each cloak into specific techniques, empowering and simultaneously locking them behind each cloak. 
Transforming from "base" into a Cloak is instantaneous; however, any change in state incurs a <small>**three turn cool-down**</small> before she can do so again. In addition to this if a spell bound to a Cloak is active, and she changes states, <small>**all effects of that spell will immediately end.**</small> 

$\quad$The aspect Adalyne has chosen to embody with her (admittedly rudimentary) Zen magic is The World. 

$\quad$Be aware, several spells have additional information attached to them. These include:
- Cooldown, abbreviated "CD", before a spell can be used again
- Effect Period, abbreviated "EP", or how long the effect of a spell lasts
- Cast time, abbreviated "CT", or how long a spell must be charged before it can be used

> [!EXAMPLE]- A note on Might
>$\quad$Over the past 17 years, Adalyne has been ceaseless in the development of her magic. She *should* have 'understood' her two Conceptual Elements as much as she could, as she had achieved the highest grade cloak with both. This would not be the case for long.
>Shortly after Blaise's hospitalization at the hands of Neloth, Adalyne comprehended something further: "Strength" and "Speed", or her understanding of both, combined to bring forth "Might", a 'second grade' Conceptual Element in that it is derived from other Conceptual Element(s) and thus literally "larger" in scope (though this does not make it inherently better.)
>$\quad$Might is the Conceptual Element of insurmountable force and change, causing uncontrollable rage in its wielders; that is, *nigh*-uncontrollable, as Adalyne asserted control over it and changed GOMA's definition of the element. 
>Adalyne is the only currently known Might user who has done this.

#### Techniques
> [!TIP]+ Tome of Strength
>
> **<small>[Cloak of Strength] (State Transformation | Strength) {Perfect Grade}</small>**
$\quad$Upon activation Adalyne is enveloped in a flamelike aura of scarlet, flecked with <small>**golden embers**</small>. This aura hovers 2-3 inches from her body, and itself has no apparent effect on surroundings (including attackers.) 
$\quad$Adalyne, after much hard work and many hours of meditation, her body has acclimated to the elevated state, and can maintain it indefinitely without any loss in stamina. It should be noted that this is exclusive to [Cloak of Strength]. Because of that, she has dubbed this "Perfect Grade." 
>
$\quad$While in this state, Adalyne's physical strength is vastly increased. Her deadlifting PB (with her magic suppressed) is 520 pounds; with [Cloak of Strength] however, her deadlifting PB (simulated with VAKTOVIA[^3]) currently sits at ~1,915 pounds. However this state incurs an expansion of muscle mass, and thus, decreased mobility when it comes to larger movements.
Considering this, [Cloak of Strength] sees the most usage whenever Adalyne needs to hold down a specific area. 
$\quad$ Spells requiring this to be active will be marked with <small>**{STR}**</small>.
>
<small>**[Crushing Mass] (Hex | Strength&Earth) {CD: 12 turns | EP: 8 turns} STR}</small>**
$\quad$Adalyne strikes the spiked butt of her poleaxe into the ground, generating a shockwave of magic that travels 15 meters in all directions; every entity hit by this shockwave that Adalyne deems an enemy will then be inflicted with [Crushing Mass]. This shockwave ignores physical obstacles that may be in the way, but arcane barriers can stop it. The effects are three-fold:
> - Any entity capable of flight (through any means) inflicted with [Crushing Mass] will immediately lose the ability to do so. Those currently in flight will fall out of the sky.
> - The effect of enemy movement-focused abilities are (mildly) reduced.
> - At the point Adalyne strikes the ground, an Anchor of congealed Strength magic is formed. All entities inflicted with [Crushing Mass], as well as Adalyne, are bound to a 15 meter diameter sphere around this spike. Because the initial casting range is larger than this, anyone who is caught outside of this range will be immediately (and violently) pulled into it. 
  This specific effect can be dispelled by destroying the Anchor; [Crushing Mass] itself will remain until it expires or is forcibly cleansed from a target. The anchor cannot be reformed outside of a full re-cast. <small>**There is a maximum force that the Anchor can put on any single entity;**</small> if this force is exceeded, the Anchor's hold on that entity will break and they will no longer be bound.
> 
<small>**[Foundation] (Passive | Earth) {STR}</small>**
$\quad$While [Cloak of Strength] is active Adalyne has an innate, arcane connection to the ground beneath her feet. While she's grounded it's much harder for an opponent to do things such as move her or destabilize her. Generally, if she wants to stay in a position, she's *going* to stay in that position.
> $\quad$Adalyne also has far more control over surrounding terrain thanks to this connection, be it dirt, rock, cement, or brick. Earthen constructs will generally be more durable.
>- [Hold the Line] (Buff | Earth) {CD: None | EP: None} <small>**{STR}**</small>
$\quad$Adalyne bangs a fist on her chest and roars. Her magic resonates with allies within 20 meters, extending to them a lesser version of its stabilization. If any affected allies have Earth, or an Earth-based element, they will receive [Foundation]'s full effects.
$\quad$This effect will last as long as Adalyne maintains [Cloak of Strength].
>
><small>**[Resonant Redirection] (Def. | STR}) {CT: 1 tr | CD: 8 tr | EP: 4 tr} {ZEN}**</small>
$\quad$Resonant Redirection must be charged and prepared a turn before use, and can be held for 4 turns before it expires. Adalyne focuses magic into her poleaxe, causing it to shine red for a few seconds. With correct timing, Adalyne blocks an attack and releases the charge.
$\quad$The kinetic energy of the attack will be perfectly redirected. In the case of a projectile, this will cause it to be sent back to its source with the exact same speed. The type of the attack being redirected is very important: Some, for example beam attacks, cannot be redirected at all. 
$\quad$If it is imbued with extraplanar magic weak to her Earth element, the redirected attack will never miss and entirely ignore her opponents elemental resistances. If it is instead resistant, redirection will fail entirely.

> [!TIP]+ Tome of Speed
> **<small>[Ilya] (Summon | Speed)</small>**
>$\quad$
>**<small>[Speed Cloak] (State Transformation | Speed) 3rd Grade</small>**
>$\quad$Upon activation, Adalyne is engulfed in a verdant flame-like aura, extending four to five inches from her body. This aura is purely visual, a by-product Adalyne hasn't taken the time to stamp out. 
>$\quad$This state heightens Adalyne's mobility considerably including her overall speed as well as dexterity, allowing her to be at the right place, at the right time, all the time. 
>In testing, on flat ground in a straight line, Adalyne has a 0-to-96 KPH time of eight seconds; her sprint PB rests at 10 km in three-and-a-half minutes, with her highest speed at 165 KPH. 
>While not able to maintain such high speeds at all times, testing on standardized agility courses shows high levels of maneuverability.
>- <small>**[Blade of Volos] (Attack | Water) {CD: 2 tr}**</small>
>$\quad$While [Speed Cloak] is active, Adalyne has the ability to fire projectiles of water from her polearm; the shape of the projectile, and its properties, depend on which part they originate from. 
>$\quad$The axhead of her poleaxe will fire blades of water (obvious enough,) which have a limited range; the spike at the top will fire beams of water, which have less power but greater range; the hammer/beak will fire short range spikes of water which are better for breaking through defenses, arcane and mundane.
