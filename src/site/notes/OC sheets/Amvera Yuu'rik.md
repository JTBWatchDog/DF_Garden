#### Description
Amvera has not been idle since her graduation from the academy. Hers is a form forged in nigh ceaseless combat. Lean, dense. 
The human side of her biology has become more subdued as her body developed over time, likely due to the influence of daemonic mana. Claws, once barely-existent, are now far more pronounced. The same extends to her horns, but especially her facial structure. Where once before was an awkward half-muzzle there now exists a proper draconic snout, equipped with the expected razor-esque teeth. 


### Info
Personality: The majority will only ever see the 'legit' side of Amvera, which really is only *partially* fabricated. She can be quite restrained, not in that she's averse to socializing but that she keeps much close to her chest. 

Behind that quiet and solid reservation lies a wild ferocity. Two seemingly contradictory sides of the same coin: Gentleness, but also cruelty; Brutality, but also gentility; As able to mend wounds as she is to deal them. 
Despite lying beyond the pale without doubt, her moral compass is specifically defined, inflexible, and she adheres to it stubbornly. Perhaps because it's now her only anchorâ€” Perhaps not.
