### ✦ Magic Name: White Phoenix 
Overall place in type triad: Offense
Elemental Properties: Fire
#### ¶ Description
Ava is regarded as the current living master of the Hawthorne Wyrgcraeft ("hidden skill" or "cursed skill") **Arcana Augere**.  Its focus is to open the Anahata chakra, the heart, center of a human magi's arcane system, and take full control; by doing so, the magi can now pressurize their magic system. Under enough pressure, mana will begin exuding from their body; this is the aura. 
The usage of this aura is the foundation of all Augere magic, and is learned through three fundamental techniques to control pressure in the arcane system: **Regulation**, to bind the aura to its user and stop it from dissipating into the environment; **Suppression**, to be able to contain the aura within; **Enhancement**, to increase pressure either in specific areas or totally.
This pressure control is the second layer of foundation since now not only do spells consume mana, they require and consume a certain amount of pressure. This is measured in standardized "levels". Ava can handle a maximum of 12. 

With pressure, comes strain. Pressure can only be produced when the Anahata is working; the rate of work is measured in "Gears". Ava has access to four of them, numbered from 0 to 3. Higher gears grant faster pressurization but put more strain on the body; this strain is then measured in levels of "Heat." Beyond level 2, her stamina begins to degrade. Beyond level 6, she'll begin taking damage. 
If Avabella reaches a Heat level of 10, she will be immediately incapacitated as the pain becomes too much to bear; she will not be able to re-engage until she recovers.

> [!example]- Anahata Gears
> - **Gear 0**: Pressure will not increase, Heat will decrease by 1 every turn.
> - **Gear 1**: Pressure +1, Heat will not increase. 
> - **Gear 2**: Pressure +2, Heat +1. 
> - **Gear 3**: Pressure +3, Heat +2. In this Gear, Avabella's blood vessels visibly bulge beneath her skin.
#### ¶ Techniques

**» Aura Transmutation: First Blaze** (Defense, Offense | Fire)
> **Occupies three mainline slots.**
> Aura transmutation in Augere is simple at first glance, but deceptively difficult. The depth of understanding of the target element required to fundamentally change ones aura is staggering. However, once achieved, it is permanent.
> Avabella's fiery aura serves as both a passive defense and an offensive utility: she can use it as a source for all of her fire magic, improving efficiency. 
> Coupled with her excellent Regulation, this means she has rendered Augere's usual passive mana loss irrelevant.
> As Pressure increases the aura will burn hotter and brighter — white at level 12 — but it will always extend .3m from her body passively. Avabella has access to basic fire manipulation with a range of 6m. This also benefits from the efficiency boost of **First Blaze**. 
> 
> **µ Kickstart** (Self | Fire)
>> This can only be used when she first activates Arcana Augere. Upon activating Augere, she can choose whether or not to use **Kickstart**. This allows her to begin with level 4 Pressure instantly, at the cost of instantly creating 5 levels of Heat. Automatically puts her in Gear 2.
>
> **µ Fire Soul** (Offense | Fire)
>> Requires level 6 Pressure, consumes 4. 
>> Single target, must be charged for 2 turns during which she must keep the target in line of sight. Ava cannot use other spells while charging.
>> Creates a spiraling beam of fire 1m in diameter, which pursues the target relentlessly until it either hits or is destroyed.
>
> **µ Wall of Thorns** (Defense | Fire)
>> Requires level 4 Pressure, consumes 2. Walls require solid ground, and only one may exist at a time. Creating a new wall dispels the pre-existing one.
>> Ava creates a mana construct wall of fire; this is slightly different from simply creating a wall of fire, because it has tangible structure. It is, effectively, fire solidified into the shape of a dense wall of thorns. She can control the size and shape of it, up to a maximum width of 10m and height of 5m.
>
>**µ Flower Burst** (Offense | Fire)
>> Requires level 4 Pressure, consumes 4.
>> Using her aura as the source she creates 4 fireballs, each the size of a basketball. They'll spin around her idly, where she can fire them at will. Upon coming within 1m of an enemy target or hitting a surface, they'll explode with a radius of 2m. Only four may exist at a time. 
>
>**µ Phoenix Song** (Offense | Fire)
>> Requires level 2 Pressure, consumes 1.
>> The aura will disappear externally, as all of it is instead concentrated into her lungs. Her chest will visibly expand, before she unleashes a fire breath attack. She can focus it as she wills, either attacking a large area (6m long, 6m wide cone) or creating a highly pressurized stream of fire (10m long, 1m wide cone.) 
>> This attack can be used multiple times in rapid succession, but will be disabled for 3 turns after she stops concentrating her aura into her lungs. If used to create a continuous stream of fire, it will consume an extra level of Pressure for every additional turn.
>
>**µ Phoenix Power: Deflect** (Defense | Fire) 
>> Requires level 6 Pressure, consumes 2. Creates an extra level of Heat on use. Disabled for 3 turns after use.
>> Combining **Suppression** and **Enhancement**, Ava seals her aura within before releasing it from one of her limbs, creating an explosion. She can use this to deflect most attacks, regardless of type or element; though element *will* still be a factor generally, because of the sheer concussive force produced, it plays less of a role. It should be noted, **Deflect** has strict timing requirements on its use. If timed even slightly wrong it has the chance to fail. 
>
> **µ Gryndæmtigg: Polarity Inversion** (Defense, Support | N/E)
>> Requires Pressure below level 6, consumes none. Reduces Heat level by 2 on activation. 8 turn cooldown. 
>> Avabella roots herself to the spot and, with great focus, inverts the aura's polarity from "positive" to "negative" and hardens it. (It should be noted this isn't 100% accurate, but it remains the best way to summarize the theory behind Gryndæmtigg.) The First Blaze transmutation is, temporarily, undone; once the aura is hardened, it almost cannot be seen, and is only visible as a faint silver bubble.
>> This is not only a decently powerful defense, but because of the polarity inversion blocking attacks becomes a regenerative action. Blocking damage will reduce her Heat level, with greater effect against projectiles and a further boost against energy-based attacks. This allows her to reduce her Heat by up to 3 more levels on top of the initial 2. However, if the shield overloads and breaks, all 5 levels of Heat reduction will be lost. 


**» Pyra** (Offense | Fire)
**✦ BEHOLD THE PYRE UPON WHICH THE PHOENIX REINCARNATES | 14 DAY COOLDOWN** 
> **Pyra** can only be initiated when Avabella has maintained Pressure level 12 for two turns. 
> When it's activated Avabella will totally recover her physical stamina and the strain her body is under will melt away; her Heat level will be reset to 0. Energy wells from the depths of her soul; one fifth of her total mana capacity is restored. 
> For the next five turns Avabella is in a hyper-energized state, during which she will be able to access the subspells of **Pyra**. In addition, her body bursts at the seams with so much heat that her every movement (above a minimum speed) is followed by a shockwave of burning mana. Her every attack seems to hit twice. Enemies that narrowly avoid her blows will still be caught by the nigh-invisible heat waves.
> 
> This technique is not without consequences: After **Pyra** ends, she will be exhausted on a spiritual level and it cannot be used again for fourteen days. During this period, her max mana capacity will be reduced by one fourth and she can only produce a maximum Pressure level of 10. The maximum Heat level she can endure drops to 8. In addition, for 48 hours, healing magic will be half as effective on her. 
> 
> **µ Rupture (Offense | Fire)**
>> Requires level 6 Pressure, consumes 1 per use. 
>> Avabella creates and throws a hyper-condensed "spark" of mana. This spark travels 2 meters per second and, upon making contact with anything, explodes into a column of fire 2m in diameter and 10m tall. This pillar will endure for one full turn. She can use it up to 3 times per turn in this manner. 
>> It's also possible to hit one spark with a faster one. The resulting explosion is strong enough that a deafening shockwave will hit right before the primary blast, both with a radius of 10m.
>> Instead of throwing it, she may choose to crush the spark in her hand instead, with a similar result only the blast extends from her hand in front of her in a cone rather than a pillar. She can only use this variation once per turn.
>
> **µ Mystery of the Brilliant Flame (Defense | Fire)**
> **✦ THE FEATHERS OF THE PHOENIX UNFURL THEN FOLD**
> **✦ A CLOAK TO FOOL THE WORLD** 
>> Resets Pressure to 0 and ends **Pyra** immediately after use. 
>> Ava erases any distinction between herself and her aura. For a brief moment, her body is transformed into pure heat energy and, in this state, her movement speed skyrockets. 
>> Once the Mystery of the Brilliant Flame is activated, Avabella can intercept any "singular" attack and destroy it. In the case of melee, the attacker is knocked back with unimaginable force.
