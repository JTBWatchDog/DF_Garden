### ✦ Magic Name: Gulthan Ūle
Overall place in type triad: Defense 
Elemental Properties: Psycholektra (Psychic & Lightning)
#### ¶ Description
Logan is the Golden Owl, successor of Rook Gataki, and his purpose like his predecessor is the protection of Dragonfall. To this purpose his expertise lies in defense matrices: his mind operates in runes and matrix structure. Sadyarushk is the language of his choice, one of the most powerful and possibly the oldest; both aspects are hotly debated. 
The power of Sadyarushk is so great that, when one rune is written, it immediately activates. This normally makes it dangerous but thanks to great proficiency, Logan can "smother" the rune with his magic to prevent premature activation. It requires great willpower and greater practice. 
The amount of focus it would take to do this, normally, would render matrix construction mid-combat inviable but even among magi Logan is not normal. 
His sensory abilities change this completely.
Logan has the ability to memorize matrices, and then construct them from sheer muscle memory — burning them onto surfaces or into the air itself with his magic — unlike almost anyone else alive. To aid this, he has at his disposal Matrix Scrolls.

These are scrolls inscribed with matrix formula too intricate for Logan to quickly draw on the fly. The writing itself is a somatic component. When he channels magic into one of these scrolls the structure of the writing on it acts; as a psychosomatic trigger, bringing the correct matrix to mind; a matrix in itself, helping him with the next step, actively unfolding from two dimensions to three; and as a sort of component as he rips the very writing from the page.
The written matrix on the page is conjured into the air where Logan simultaneously draws the other portion to complete it. After this the scroll is left blank, able to be re-written and used again.

To use a Matrix Scroll, he must first retrieve it and have it **in his hand**. Under most conditions, this takes him a turn, but he's still able to fight and do other things while retrieving a scroll considering his telepathy.

Coupling his runic expertise is his unique elemental affinity: Psycholektra. The unstoppable force of electricity conjoined with the structure of psionic power. 
Logan has never encountered anything else quite like it. 
To summarize, his Psychic and Lightning affinities have fused beyond the point of separation; individual use is now impossible for him. The effects are numerous namely, when using telekinesis soon after the fusion, he had to learn to *not* electrocute the held item. Logan was quite surprised when he lifted a cup and accidentally pumped several thousand volts through it. His carpet still bears the soot stain.

#### ¶ Techniques
**» One True Sense** (Self, Passive || N/E)
**₯ REFINEMENT OF THE INBORN GIFT**
> Logan was born with arcane senses only comparable to that of magi 30 years his senior. So great was this even at 5 he could sense the heart problems in his cousin Simon, but of course back then he couldn't articulate what he felt let alone get anyone to listen to him. Simon died a year later.
> So great are they now that if he's familiar with an uncloaked magi's signature, he can pinpoint their exact location provided they're within 100m of him. 
> 
> Added on top of this is the technique **One True Sense**, in which the mental barriers between all of his senses have been removed. Combined and overlapped like this, they amplify each other. He has rewired his brain both biologically and magically. 
> This more comprehensive perception of the world may make it seem to the outside observer like Logan can see in every direction and even through walls, but it's both more complicated than that and less extreme. 
> As a side effect, Logan is far more resilient to hexes and attacks targeting the senses. Even if one sense is completely disabled, the others easily compensate.

**» Psioelectric Discipline** (Self | Psycholektra)
> This spell consumes two slots.
> Psionics and lightning, conjoined together, supercharge each other. His range for psioelectric control is 8m, "psioelectric control" comprising techniques such as telekinesis and fine-grain electricity control. This greatly enhances the power of his swords. He can send techniques beyond this range but in most cases, past 8m he no longer has direct control.
> If he has the time to do so Logan may use an ability called **"Capacitance"**. This allows Logan to act as a capacitor and charge his abilities further. While channeling **Capacitance** he's free to move and engage in physical combat, but **cannot** cast other spells.
> For every turn channeled (marked at the beginning of every turn) the very next technique will be stronger and gain an additional meter of range, until level 5 is reached. At **Capacitance** level 5, the "Bunker Buster" effect becomes active. The very next attack will be supremely effective against defenses both physical and arcane, with a total range amplification of 10m. 
> There is no benefit beyond level 5. A Capacitance charge may be held indefinitely, but cannot be channeled again for 4 turns after it is discharged. 
> 
> **µ Friction Control** (Self, Passive | Psycholektra)
>> This allows Logan to control his friction with any and every surface or object individually, including, namely, the ground. When removing all friction with the ground the effect is like ice skating, but even greater. Logan can also walk or run on any surface including walls by increasing his friction with that surface. 
>> Allows Logan to move and position himself in ways that look comical but are devastatingly effective.
>
> **µ Áwa wehte** (Offense | Psycholektra)
>> Requires one of his swords. Must be charged for one turn, during which his current sword will glow bright blue.
>> Logan swings his sword to create up to three slashing waves of finely condensed psycholectric energy. These waves will hang suspended in the air for that turn, before flying forward at high speed on the next. Cooldown of 4 turns after use.
>
> **µ Þyddan** (or Thyddan) (Self, Passive | Psycholektra) 
>> Logan's telekinetic and electric prowess, now one and the same. Electro-telekinetic... Psyelekinetic... Psycholektrikinetic... Whatever, electric brain power makes stuff move fast. Grabbing things, throwing things, stopping things, self-propulsion when in the air or skating everywhere with Friction Control, things like that. 
>> It has an effective range of 8m in a sphere around him with a limited amount of force he can exude at any given time, reduced if he's airborne (for complicated reasons.) This makes it so he can't fly. He *can* glide though, and fall from effectively any height without taking damage. Also helps him walk and run on any surface combined with Friction Control. 
>> This passively increases the power of all of his melee combat. When he fights without holding back, his every movement leaves behind a trail of sparks.
>
> **µ Circuit Break Riposte** (Defense | Psycholektra)
>> Logan creates an electric circuit between him and his blade before taking up a defensive stance. When blocking an attack while Circuit Break is active, the electric circuit is disturbed. Logan must initiate Circuit Break one turn before it activates, and can maintain this defensive stance for up to two turns.
>> When combined with his One True Sense, Circuit Break allows him to block and then riposte *instantly.* A secondary effect is that, on initial success, Circuit Break can repeatedly chain into itself within the same turn allowing Logan to block a flurry of many attacks (like a hail of arrows or other projectiles) and immediately follow up.
>
> **µ Revolution** (Defense | Psycholektra)
>> This is actually built on the theory behind Arcana Augere, despite not using it. Logan puts pressure on his magic and expels it while "spinning" it with extreme force. At the same time, he spins in the same direction. Almost instantly, a dome shield of rotating psionic lightning is formed. It should be noted there are many, many smaller issues that arose and had to be dealt with before it became viable.
>> The resulting shield is very durable, and incredibly violent; it will try to shred anything which makes contact with it. The mana drain is extremely high, thanks to the extremely high energy density: Logan can only get 4-5 turns of usage before completely exhausting his mana supply.

**» Bunker Charms** (Defense | Psycholektra)
> Logan has several defensive charms at his disposal. Occupies two slots.
> The first of these is simply "Protect", which requires a specific stance and a power word as somatic component: Logan holds his current weapon in front of him and says "Ge-beorga". At once, a curved circular shield forms from the tip of his weapon. The rune matrix is quite simple.
> While not particularly strong, it is exceedingly simple and fast. Cannot be used again for 1 turn if dispelled, and 3 turns if broken. 
>
> **µ Malkarin's Enchantment of Reinforcement** (Defense | Psycholektra)
>> MER reinforces a targeted, pre-existing structure or building, protecting it via a "battery" that can absorb so much damage before the enchantment unravels and the structure becomes vulnerable again. 
>> The matrix takes the form of the astrogram, which is like a pentagram with a four-pointed star in a bounding circle instead of five. Lining the inside of the bounding circle is a runic script divided into four looping sections, the centers of which lie on the points of the astrogram. 
>> To weave the enchantment he can do so manually or with a scroll. Cannot be applied manually in combat. For MER, he carries one scroll. 
>> Manual application requires Logan to circumnavigate the structure and draw the matrix as he goes, tapping his sword to the four points of the astrogram to charge it. Remains for 6 months or until the battery is depleted. 
>
> **µ Ealíþyddan** (Defense | Psycholektra) (Matrix Scroll)
>> Logan's own creation based on Malkarin's work. The matrix foundation of Ealíþyddan is a translucent [pentagonal icositetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_icositetrahedron), centered on Logan to use himself as the catalyst. Its faces are [Floret pentagons](https://polytope.miraheze.org/wiki/Pentagonal_icositetrahedron), irregular pentagons with three short and two long sides, arranged into 6 identical sets of four, which are arranged with their long sides together into an almost pyramid like shape. These cells repeat and interlock together. The resulting shield is 8m in diameter, centered on Logan. 
>> Ealíþyddan can be considered to be a "bunker" charm in the truest sense. Nothing gets in, nothing gets out. The shield is incredibly durable, and can remain in place for an extended period of time, up to 8 turns if unbroken. For as long as it's active Logan must remain in place. He may choose to dispel it at anytime.
>> However, in exchange for its power, it places Logan at great risk. As he's at the epicenter of the matrix, should the shield be destroyed the arcane backlash from the matrix dissolving falls directly on him; Logan will take a great deal of internal damage, as the shock floods his system, and be dazed for 3-4 turns.
>> 
>> Relies on matrix scrolls and cannot be used in combat without them. Logan carries two small scrolls for Ealíþyddan. Can be cast near-instantly after the scroll is retrieved.
>
> **µ Breach Seal** (Defense | Psycholektra) (Matrix Scroll)
>> Patches pre-existing physical structures that have been damaged. This can be used to patch holes in physical defenses, like walls, or to stop any structure from collapsing. Requires an additional turn of setup. Logan chooses two or more anchor points for the matrix within 16m of him, and between them weaves a lattice of condensed psycholektric will. This patchwork reinforcement is long-lasting and sturdy, able to persist for up to a month if it isn't actively destroyed. The lattice weaving takes place on the same turn as anchor point creation; Breach Seal takes 2 turns to perform. 
>> Logan carries one scroll for Breach Seal.
>
> **µ Gewǽreld** (Defense | Psycholektra) (Matrix Scroll)
>> Allows Logan to create shields for an ally at ranges of up to 30m. Logan retrieves the scroll and focuses on the target, which requires Logan to be able to perceive them (not necessarily line of sight), for one turn; the shield is created on the third turn. If the targeted ally is grounded, the shield has a curved rectangular shape and 3m tall and 1.5m wide. If the targeted ally is airborne, the shield is a curved disc 2.5m in diameter. This shield will remain in place for 6 turns if it is not destroyed. 
>> Logan carries two scrolls for Gewǽreld.
>
> **µ Ward Creation** (Defense | Psycholektra)
>> Does not use matrix scrolls. Logan draws a linked quatrainic series of magic bands around a friendly target, specifying a damage type to protect them against. Requires Logan's focus and for the target to remain within 8m of Logan for three turns. Once the ward is completed, it acts as a shield with a battery, consuming mana to block attacks dealing that damage type. The ward can be visualized as a thin bubble that fully encapsulates the target, hovering a few inches above their body. It can block between 1-8 attacks, depending on the strength of the attack and how much power Logan stores in the ward, before it unravels and ceased to exist. The available damage types are Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing.


**» ARCNET** (Defense, Offense | Psycholektra)
 **₯ THE BIG ONE**
 > The matrix scroll for **ARCNET** is 24" wide and 32' long, requiring ~300h of work to create, or about 4 months if he works on it 2.5h per day. Its tube container is 28" long and 8" in diameter. The tube is heavily warded, powered by two battery crystals. It remains in his presence at *all* times, usually strapped perpendicularly across his lower back. To date, he has not allowed a single living soul to see the formula.
 > **ARCNET** is composed of two parts, both requiring Logan's complete attention for 3 turns to construct. Any interruption will revert his progress, but only for that part and without risk. After interruption he  Once a part is finished that progress is considered "safe". He may choose to abort the technique while still constructing the first piece, but after it's finished, there's no turning back.
 > 
 > The first stage is a two-fold amplification matrix tower of willpower made physical, which is constructed beneath Logan and slowly lifts him into the air. He may make it any height he desires, up to 15m tall.
 > The second stage is a cylindrical bounding field, looking like a dense web of electric blue spidersilk, 32m in diameter centered his position; the height of the cylinder is 10m plus the height of the matrix tower. These two pieces are connected remotely, and once both are completed, everything within the bounding field can now be considered to be "inside" Logan's magic.
 > 
 > Once **ARCNET** is completed Logan gains *total* awareness within the bounding field. There is *nothing* that can escape his senses. The range of his magic extends everywhere within the bounding field, and any efficiency loss from performing attacks at range is nullified. For so long as **ARCNET** is active Logan's magic power skyrockets. He can reinforce any structure within the field on the fly, create shields of psioelectric power to protect his allies, and blast projectiles out of the air. 
 > However, Logan may not leave his perch upon the amplification tower. If he's knocked off of it **ARCNET** will IMMEDIATELY fail without chance for recovery, but this is the only "direct" way to destroy **ARCNET**. Of course if he runs out of mana, then it will also fail. 

### ✦ Gear
#### ¶ Bealkadā
Elemental properties: **Psycholektra**
Catalyst: **Y**
##### µ Description
Logan's Montante Bealkadā has an overall length of 66" and a blade length of 50". The long crossguard is not accompanied by side rings as he's found they get in his way far more than they're worth. Above the crossguard is the ricasso. The ricasso is an unsharpened portion of the blade handled during halfswording, and is protected by parrying hooks, effectively a smaller crossguard. 

The most striking aspect of the Montante is the blade. The metal is the purest white, like ivory. 

Bealkadā's creation was a joint effort between the Hawthorne family and Blaise Corbin. The weapon, from before creation, has been fully saturated with Logan's magic. He is able to call it to his side regardless of distance, so long as it has a viable path to get to him. Logan also has a general sense of where Bealkadā is at all times, again regardless of distance. 

#### ¶ Thundael 
Elemental properties: **Psycholektra**
Catalyst: **Y**

##### µ Description
Logan's secondary weapon Thundael, a bastard sword. It has an overall length of 49" and a blade length of 38". Unlike Bealkadā, the crossguard is accompanied by side rings. However, like Bealkadā, Thundael's blade is the purest ivory white.

Same functional ability as Bealkadā, but is a bastard sword, better suited for situations where the size of the Montante is disadvantageous.


#### ¶ Scroll holster(s)
Elemental properties: **Psycholektra**
Catalyst: **Y**

##### µ Description
A holster for Logan's matrix scrolls, basically just a few pieces of leather joined together with 6 slots for his regular-sized scrolls. Is shielded to stop them from being obliterated at the start of every fight, powered by a battery crystal. All of the scrolls are easily retrievable via telekinetics.
The tube for **ARCNET**, strapped perpendicular across his lower back, has far more powerful shielding. The massive, mildly ornate ~~aura-farming~~ tube subtly radiates power.
