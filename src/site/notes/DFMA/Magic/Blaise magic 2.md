### ✦ Magic Name: Witchdoctor
Overall place in type triad: Support
Elemental Properties: Metal(Earth), Wind, Spirit, **Zen**
#### ¶ Description

> [!EXAMPLE]- ¶ Racial Perk: Dorraul Markana
> Arcane tattoos carried by magi of the Dorraul kobold Branch, native to the cultural region of Acuria. They are a mystery, an interface between magic and biology. 
> Metallic Markana cover: the entirety of Blaise's back, the entirety of her tail, portions of her shoulders, portions of her collarbone, and the entire undersides of her wings. They're perfectly visible, despite Blaise's feathery development; wherever the feathers cover the Markana they are stained by their metallic power. These metal-stained feathers shimmer in the light, and when Blaise begins casting greater magics, the image her Markana can be seen projecting itself into the air around her.
> Blaise has the largest and most complex Markana of her Branch's known history. 
> 
> A cobalt cross, stylized similarly to the Fleur-de-lis, stretches the length of her spine, and the beam of the cross extends across her shoulder blades, in front of abstract background of flowing green and jagged red patterns. Imposed on her back are two distinct portions of text, one over the cross in white and either side of it in black. This text bears some resemblance to a few runic scripts, but remains unreadable to this day. This is surrounded by a border of cobalt thorns and vines; these extend over her shoulders, her collarbone, and all the way down her tail. The undersides of her wings have a coat of solid, reflective silver. The outerside of her wings are marked as well, and when folded, they form a large singular rune bisected by the vertical beam of the cross.
> 
> The Markana are responsible for her metamorphosis and her transition in the past, but also for increasing the power of her flight. She believes they're largely responsible for her ability to commune with spirits directly as well. 

Advanced medical capabilities, herbological and mana-powered; the power to speak with, bargain with, and sealing prowess to bind spirits to her will; well-versed in runes and matrices; in tune with the will of the world, with chains to bind angels and demons alike; the only way to sufficiently describe Blaise, her abilities, and her role is as a Witchdoctor. With the right ingredients, sufficient knowledge, sufficient power, sufficient time... anything can be healed. It is only ever a lack of one or more of these things that leads to "impossibility," theoretically, anyway. 

Her ultimate mission is, of course, the pursuit of the **Philosopher's Stone**, such as was the mission of many before her regardless of the name they gave it. Whether she will ever achieve it matters not. On this journey, every next step is the destination in itself.
#### ¶ Techniques
**» Zavet Lovaca** (Passive || Spirit, **Zen**)
> The Vow is the bottommost foundation of Blaise's abilities. The Vow is her anchor. The Vow is what makes *everything* work. This pledge is one made not only to herself, but to nature, to mortality, to the very ground beneath her feet. Bound by Lovaca, she must have respect for the breath of life present in all things. 
> Blaise cannot kill any living thing except in defense of herself, in defense of another, or for sustenance. In all cases the respect of life must be maintained. Blaise cannot turn away any person requiring medical aid, regardless of affiliation, who comes to her in peace and honesty. So long as it is in her power and it is asked of her earnestly, she **must** give aid. She cannot deny even the worst monsters of mortalkind. 
> It is not her role to be executioner. 
> **✦ The consequence of violating these principles is death.**
> All of Blaise's magic is amplified by the Vow, but the power of her **Zen** techniques the most. 
> 
> **µ Sorcerer Apprentice's Gnosis** (Passive || Spirit)
>> Blaise's ability to perceive and commune with spirits, whether extraplanar or Gaian in nature. 
>> This ability is made possible by her Markana first, but made powerful by her Vow because the Vow is the culmination of self-understanding: Zavet Lovaca is the purest distillation of everything Blaise both is and desires to be. This understanding of and authority over her own spirit and character helps protect her from being manipulated by even the strongest of spirits. Because of this, Blaise is naturally resistant to possession and spiritual or psychic manipulation.
>> Blaise has the ability to call forth the spirits out of nature itself. The power of these spirits varies wildly. In all cases however she strives to treat them with respect, and must work with them either on an equal level, or with them on a higher one. 
>> 
>> She has the ability to bind spirits to her will, limited by her own power, but spirits are cunning and wild things and if one does not want to deal with her she cannot force it to change its mind. She *can* force it to deal with her, but only with much difficulty and danger to herself.
>> 
>> **Hyolel** is one of these spirits bound to her will, and Blaise's companion. The binding is loose; Hyolel enjoys the companionship of Blaise and vice versa. He acts as a messenger for her, able to carry messages vast distances in little time, and feeds on her magic in return.


**» Tidal Seal** (Passive || Metal, Spirit)
> The Tidal Seal is a mana storage technique developed by Blaise, composed of two pieces on her forehead: The Gate and the Well. Firstly, the Gate is a white matrix structure like a hexagram constructed on a horizontally elongated hexagon. 
> Contained within this is the Well, mana given structure which is then folded in on itself repeatedly; this is distinct from compression based storage: the folded structure remains even when depleted and only need to be recharged, where compression based storage requires work to re-compress the mana. The Well is comprised of 6 black rhombuses, or diamonds, arranged into a hexagonal shape with white gaps between. This in-folding structure sacrifices some capacity, but in turn has far greater stability. Contained within the Gate is a smaller store of energy, dedicated to maintaining the structure of the Well.
> 
> Each diamond is equivalent to, roughly, 2/3rds of Blaise's normal mana supply, which is equivalent with the 'average' B-rank mage. These can be thought of as "charges". When all are fully charged they hold 4x her mana supply. Recovering an exhausted charge will typically take her a week. 
>
> **µ Revivify** (Support || Spirit) **3 Charges** 
>> Revivify is Blaise's strongest in-combat healing ability, requiring total focus and both hands.
>> In her left hand, she prepares a Talisman. Blaise draws 3 Charges from within the Well and focuses the mana into her right hand, the incredible density of which creates the appearance of a brilliant, ghostly white flame. This process takes 3 turns of focus. Once the technique is established Blaise can touch the flames to an incapacitated ally to restore them to ~80% health, and ~50% of their mana supply, at maximum. 
>> Revivify does not simply accelerate the body's natural healing by suffusing it with mana: Defined within the talisman, Revivify is a series of simultaneous functions designed to deal with the vast majority of injuries; the technique is far more complex than standard healing, but far less than something as powerful as mitotic regeneration. 
>
> **µ Dheghom** (Hex || Spirit) **2 Charges**
>> Dheghom allows Blaise to obscure the world and her allies in illusion. Requires her undivided focus for two turns during which pale mist will begin to billow off her body. This mist will rapidly expand to cover the ground in a 30m diameter circle. On the third turn, Dheghom activates. Every enemy within 30m of Blaise at that moment will be ensnared.
>> The world of Dheghom is cast in the twilight of a massive full moon, regardless of the actual time of day, and engulfed in baleful mist. Blaise and all of her allies are cloaked in darkness, and indistinguishable from each other; mixed in with them are 6 illusory allies. These ghosts are "tangible", and can attack Blaise's enemies, but the wounds they cause are illusory and purely in the mind. They dispel with one hit and upon being destroyed any "wounds" they have caused will also vanish. 
>> Dheghom is a static illusory field that persists for 6 turns. The field cannot be left, but may be entered, through conventional means; it may be dispelled by incapacitating Blaise, or being attacked directly by those with exceptional sensory abilities.
>
> **µ Talon Ha-ewsōs** (Offense, Hex | Spirit, Wind) **2 Charges**
>> Ha-ewsōs the brilliant, the gold-throned, shining red from afar, shooting ruddy beams of light. She is called by name Talon of Dyēus. Does not require Blaise's continual focus but only acts 6 turns after being called, the incantation for which requires one turn to complete and targets one person. 
>> On the sixth turn a brilliant light will shine from the east. In that instant, an ethereal red phoenix will appear. Ha-ewsōs will attack the target's face, taking the light from one of their eyes and temporarily forcing it shut; in her talons she will take it, having the appearance of a shining white marble, and the light of their eye will not return until they take it back or Ha-ewsōs departs after 8 turns. The wounds inflicted by Ha-ewsōs are purely spiritual, and if she departs or is dispelled, their eyesight will return at once. 

**» Field Medic Discipline** (Support || Metal, Spirit)
> Diagnostic charms to scan the body, to discern the true nature of injuries and hexes. The simplest one takes one turn, but is the weakest and curses of sufficient guile can escape detection. The longer Blaise looks, the less likely it is for anything to escape her notice. 
> Various other charms enable: sterilization, to prevent infections; control of blood flow, to prevent excessive bleeding; the clearing of blocked airways, and the restoration of destroyed ones; to reduce or eliminate pain; to revive, or to put to sleep; and, of course, to infuse the body with mana for basic healing. She can also conjure various medical implements, including but not limited to: floating stretchers, braces, splints, casts, scalpels, tweezers, bandages, gauze, and absorbent wound dressings. 
> Blaise is also able to transfer mana from herself to others to replenish their supply.
> 
> **µ Rite of Borwecht** (Support || Spirit, **Zen**)
>> Blaise holds the power to cleanse hexes and curses from her allies. She must remain within 3m of the target for 4 turns, and on the next turn the target will be cleansed. The original caster of the curse will know when she begins the cleansing. After a successful rite, the target cannot be inflicted with the same curses or hexes again for the duration of the fight. Has a cooldown of 4 turns. 
>> Extremely effective against Light and Dark-elemental magic of Extraplanar origin. Cannot cleanse Fire or Psychic-elemental magic of Extraplanar origin. 
>
> **µ Second Wind** (Support || Wind)
>> Has a cast time or 3 turns and a cooldown of 4. Blaise infuses her magic into the air around her, creating a strong breeze that blows over her allies, restoring their stamina and mana. This breeze has a maximum range of 30m. 
>

**» Winds of Gaia** (Self || Wind, **Zen**)
> The foundation of Blaise's wind magic, and her ability to shape the wind. Her wind magic has a base range of 30m, with the effort required increasing with distance up to that point. This amplifies her ability to fly considerably. Using her war scythe as a catalyst, directing it physically (like with airbending from ATLA) strengthens her wind magic considerably. 
> **✦ All of Blaise's magic has been imbued with Zen magic.**
> Extraplanar magi with Electricity or Earth elements will be critically weak to her wind magic, while Extraplanar magi with Fire or Water elements will be resistant to it.
> 
> **µ Gale Claw** (Offense || Wind, Metal, **Zen**)
>> This is an instant-cast style spell with a cooldown of 6 turns.
>> Blaise forms a series of slashing projectiles from the end of her war scythe, which fly forward at incredible speed. Blaise can fire up to 12 of these in a chain. Super effective against extraplanar users of Electricity & Earth; not very effective against extraplanar users of Fire & Water.
>> Blaise can use her wings to cast a variant of this spell which launches all 12 projectiles at once, with a cooldown of 9 turns. Both variants share the same cooldown.
>
> **µ Symphony of Destruction** (Hex || Wind, Spirit, **Zen**)
>> This is a continuous-cast style spell, using Blaise's singing as a medium. Requires her to sing for two turns before its effect can activate; if it's disrupted at any point, progress resets. Has a cooldown of 4 turns after ending or being disrupted. 
>> Enemies who can hear her singing will be less receptive to healing techniques, and old wounds will begin to spiritually manifest on their bodies, causing pain and slowly draining their stamina. These gradually disappear after Symphony of Destruction ends. 
>> Extraplanar magi with Dark, Light, or Electric elements will be critically weak to this; Extraplanar users of Fire, Water, or Mind/Psychic elements will be immune.
>
> **µ Great Whirlwind** (Defense || Wind, **Zen**)
>> This is an instant-cast style spell with a cooldown of 6 turns. 
>> Blaise uses her war scythe to whip up a stationary whirlwind six across in front of her, which catches blocks attacks and catches projectiles before dropping them to the ground. This whirlwind is only lasts for two turns. 
>> She can use her wings to cast a stronger variant of Great Whirlwind centered on herself, which only lasts for one turn and has a cooldown of 9 turns. Both variants share the same cooldown.

**» Incense and Iron** (Self, Defense || Metal, Spirit)
> Blaise's feathers conduct her Metal and Spirit elements exceptionally well. Her Spirit element allows her to change the form of her wings, and her Metal element makes them incredibly strong. Blaise's wings may be disguised as any form of clothing, able to be revealed and concealed at any moment. She may conduct a higher level of Metal magic to increase their defensive abilities, but doing so makes her unable to fly.
