The human side of her biology has become more subdued over time, likely due to the influence of daemonic mana. Claws, once barely-existent, are now far more pronounced. 
The same extends to her horns, but especially her facial structure: Where once before was an awkward half-muzzle there now exists a proper draconic snout, equipped with the expected razor-sharp teeth. Four of her canines have been replaced with a gold-catalyst alloy.
When her Aizura become active, her eyes become **Super-luminous** white, with a faded green bismuth fractal contained therein. 

#### ¶ Personality
Amvera is a very loud and "in your face" type of person, with buckets of confidence to spare. A criminal and vanguard both. Her ironclad moral code only partially lines up with the law, and of course a lot of people are gonna see her as a violent anarcho-socialist; they're not (entirely) wrong, but fuck them. 
To a cult following she's the beloved voice of the underground music group **Lazrteq**. Started by Amvera and a few friends in 712, **Lazrteq** is loved for their alternative sound mixing hardcore punk with gangster rap & underground hiphop.

### ✦ Magic Name:
Overall place in type triad: Offense 
Elemental Properties: Fire, Wood(Earth), Wind || **Underworld**
#### ¶ Description


On Wildfyre:
> Wildfyre is a variant of Fiendfyre unique to Amvera. After college, in long hours of meditation she was transported to another plane; here, she awakened Fiendfyre within her. Amvera took that flame, beyond control, and bent it to heel. Thus Wildfyre was born.
> Wildfyre, while easier to control, creates a byproduct of "daemonic flux" when used; this is a type of mana that is corrosive, and cannot be used in regular spellcasting. Amvera can hold 4 charges of flux before taking damage over time, increasing exponentially with each charge. Expelling a charge of flux takes one turn, and takes part of her attention away from other spellcasting.
