Following her metamorphosis, Blaise has taken on an *extremely* avian appearance. Feathers cover most of her body, with scales only visible in a few key areas; around the face, her hands and wrists, among others. The sclera of her eyes have become a shockingly vibrant red with a blue iris. 
The way her mouth and nose are arranged has become profoundly beak-like. Her horns have also grown, now 33 cm long, gently curving backward with a ridge spiraling from base to tip.

Her body coloration is divided into two cohesive regions: "underside" or "inner" areas, which are cerulean with white undertones which include the insides of her wings and underside of her tail but also the front of her torso, her legs, arms, and neck; and "topside" or "outer" areas, which include the outerside of her wings and topside of her tail, but also her back, shoulders, and collarbone.

#### ¶Techniques
» Contract of Muni (Passive | Spirit | **Zen**)
	Blaise took a vow 

» Key of Solomon (Offense | N/E | **Single Use**)
	There is a three-dimensional runic spell formula bound to both of Blaise's arms. This formula structure appears to consume the entirety of her arms, from deltoid to wrist, below the hypodermis; uncertainty clouds it. The formula structure cannot be viewed. 
	Means both mundane and arcane have all failed to scan the structure.
	It cannot be seen or read by any means.
	This technique can only be used on Neloth.
	.
	Blaise *must* place her hands on two points of Neloth's host body. Her left hand *must* be placed on the Ru Zhong pressure point, the Anahata chakra, on the sternum; Her right hand *must* be placed on the Yin Tang pressure point, the Ajna chakra, between the medial ends of the eyebrows.
	When, and only when, she does this can she use **Key of Solomon**.
	With **Key of Solomon**, Blaise holds the power to erase any seal. There could be an infinite amount of power behind the seal; it will be erased regardless.
	Once **Key of Solomon** is used, it will be lost forever. 
	It cannot be recreated by any means.
