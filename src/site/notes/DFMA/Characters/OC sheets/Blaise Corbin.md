Following her metamorphosis, Blaise has taken on an *extremely* avian appearance. Feathers cover most of her body, with scales only visible in a few key areas; around the face, her hands and wrists, among others. The sclera of her eyes have become a shockingly vibrant red with a blue iris. 
The way her mouth and nose are arranged has become profoundly beak-like. Her horns have also grown, now 33 cm long, gently curving backward with a ridge spiraling from base to tip.

Her body coloration is divided into two cohesive regions: "underside" or "inner" areas, which are cerulean with white undertones which include the insides of her wings and underside of her tail but also the front of her torso, her legs, arms, and neck; and "topside" or "outer" areas, which include the outerside of her wings and topside of her tail, but also her back, shoulders, and collarbone.

#### ¶ Backstory





### ✦ Magic Name: Witchdoctor
Overall place in type triad: Support
Elemental Properties: Metal, Wind, Spirit
#### ¶ Description

> [!EXAMPLE]- ¶ Racial Perk: Dorraul Markana
> $\quad$Blaise's arcane tattoos. Kobold magi of several specific species can be born with them. They are a direct interface between magic and biology, developing with the mage throughout life. These markings have a metallic appearance.


#### ¶Techniques
**» Zavet Lovaca** (Passive || Spirit || **Zen**)
> *The Hunter's Vow* is an integral part of Blaise's **Zen** magic; without it, her Zen magic as it is now would cease to function.
> Blaise cannot consume any meat which she has not killed herself. In addition, all of her kills must be made without magic. Her kills must be made in a certain way, according respect to the animals she kills.
> *The Hunter's Vow* forms the foundation of all Zen magic used by Blaise, amplifying their strength.
> **µ Praznina**, or **Null** (Self || N/E)
>> Null is the sole exception to the "no magic" clause of **Zavet Lovaca**. This ability allows Blaise to completely close off her magic system, trapping 100% of her magic in her body. In this state, she is invisible to most magic sensory techniques. Combined with her hunting experience, Blaise has considerable stealth ability in this state at the cost of being unable to use other techniques.
