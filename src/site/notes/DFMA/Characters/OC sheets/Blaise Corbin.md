Following her metamorphosis, Blaise has taken on an *extremely* avian appearance. Feathers cover most of her body, with scales only visible in a few key areas; around the face, her hands and wrists, among others. The sclera of her eyes have become a shockingly vibrant red with a blue iris. 
The way her mouth and nose are arranged has become profoundly beak-like. Her horns have also grown, now 33 cm long, gently curving backward with a ridge spiraling from base to tip.

Her body coloration is divided into two cohesive regions: "underside" or "inner" areas, which are cerulean with white undertones which include the insides of her wings and underside of her tail but also the front of her torso, her legs, arms, and neck; and "topside" or "outer" areas, which include the outerside of her wings and topside of her tail, but also her back, shoulders, and collarbone.

#### ¶ Backstory





### ✦ Magic Name: Witchdoctor
Overall place in type triad: Support
Elemental Properties: Metal, Wind, Spirit
#### ¶ Description

> [!EXAMPLE]- ¶ Racial Perk: Dorraul Markana
> $\quad$Blaise's arcane tattoos. Kobold magi of several specific species can be born with them. They are a direct interface between magic and biology, developing with the mage throughout life. These markings have a metallic appearance.


#### ¶Techniques
**» Zavet Lovaca** (Passive || Spirit || **Zen**)
> *The Hunter's Vow* is an integral part of Blaise's **Zen** magic; without it, her Zen magic as it is now would cease to function.
> Blaise cannot consume any meat which she has not killed herself. In addition, all of her kills must be made without magic. Her kills must be made in a certain way, according respect to the animals she kills.
> *The Hunter's Vow* forms the foundation of all Zen magic used by Blaise, amplifying their strength.
> **µ Praznina**, or **Null** (Self || N/E)
>> Null is the sole exception to the "no magic" clause of **Zavet Lovaca**. This ability allows Blaise to completely close off her magic system, trapping 100% of her magic in her body. In this state, she is invisible to most magic sensory techniques. Combined with her hunting experience, Blaise has considerable stealth ability in this state at the cost of being unable to use other techniques.

**» Paramedic Discipline** (Support || N/E OR Metal)
> This is the foundation of Blaises medical ability.
> Using her focal wand, Blaise can do the following:
> 
> **Cast Diagnostic charms**
> These are charms which scan a patients body for injury as well as returning general medical information. This can detect most ailments and hexes, unless they are specially resistant.
> 
> **Perform basic healing**
> Uses her magic as fuel to speed natural healing in the area. Very simple, adequate for many injuries. May fail in extreme cases without the aid of more advanced arts.
> 
> **Perform advanced medical arts**
> Involves:
> - Creation of medical implements using metal magic, such as splints, scalpels, sutures, and others
> - Anti-infection or sterilization charms
> - Charms for controlling bleeding, airway management, resuscitation, and immobilization in case of head or spinal injury
>   
> **µ Physician Spirit** (Support || Spirit)
>> Blaise sets a spirit under her command to watch over one of her allies. This can only be applied to one person, and will grant that person passive healing for 9 turns. While Blaise has to be within 2 meters to apply the spirit, after application there is no limitation to range as the spirit will follow its charge. 
>> Except for techniques specially tailored to target spirits, the Physician Spirit cannot be disturbed. After usage, the spirit is exhausted and cannot be used again in the same fight.
>
> **µ Rite of Borwecht** (Support || Spirit || **Zen**)
>> Blaise can cleanse allies of moderate hexes, debuffs, and poisons provided the time to do so. For four turns Blaise must remain within 1 meter of the target, on the fourth turn one hex/debuff/poison will be neutralized.
>> Rite of Borwecht has a secondary effect pertaining to Extraplanar magic. For four turns after the Rite is used on a target, said target cannot be afflicted with hexes inflicted by extraplanar Light or Dark magic. In turn, extraplanar Fire or Psychic-based hexes cannot be cleansed by Rite of Borwecht.

**» Howl of Devanna** (Hex || Spirit, Wind)
> Howl of Devanna has a seven turn cooldown, and a three turn charge time in which Blaise cannot cast other spells but is free to move. As it charges she will develop an increasingly brilliant silver aura.
> Upon casting, Blaise will howl at the sky. At the moment of casting, a wave of magic spreads from Blaise in a 12m radius, ensnaring all things it catches. Everyone caught will see the world as if it were midnight for six turns, with an abnormally large and bright full moon directly overhead.
> 
> Enemies ensnared by this hex will begin to hallucinate, believing they are fighting more opponents than they are in reality. Randomly, any of Blaise's allies (or Blaise herself) may appear to be one of these phantoms, or any of these phantoms may appear to be one of Blaise's allies. When one of these phantoms are hit, they will disappear and not return.

> Sactuary (Defense | Spirit, Metal | **Zen**)
> 
> Initializing Sanctuary requires her war scythe and a calm mind. On the turn it is activated, Blaise creates a subtle aura of Spirit magic around her. On the first turn this aura extends in a 1m radius around her, and will expand another meter every turn until it reaches a 4m radius on the fourth turn. This aura allows her to respond to any threat entering it's range with extreme speed and accuracy. This is Sanctuary's first function.
> The second function is found in her war scythe which, as Sanctuary endures, gains greater and greater defensiveg power until the fourth turn, upon which it gains the power to unravel B-rank Extraplanar Light, Dark, and Fire attacks on contact. For as long as Sanctuary endures, Blaise is critically weak to Extraplanar Psychic or Lightning attacks. This weakness takes priority in mixed-element matchups.
> 
> The aura of Sanctuary becomes stationary after enduring for 4 turns, and will dissolve if Blaise leaves it.
