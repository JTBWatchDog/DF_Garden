##### Physical description
$\quad$Adalynes form is the result of 17 years of ceaseless, fervid training. Her adherence to her diet, her commitment to the evolution of her magic, and her devotion to the cultivation of her fighting ability can only be described as zealous and frenzied. 
$\quad$Her body reflects this, in every aspect. 
$\quad$She looks like a woman who has picked heavy things up, put them down again, and then done that a few tens of billions of times over the past 17 or so years.

$\quad$Adalyne possesses a large pair of ram-esque horns, made of a dark gray type of keratin. The tip of her right horn is broken off. This was purposeful and self-inflicted:
$\quad$It is the custom of the Viara Du'ul clan, that any who become a widow do such to themselvesâ€” This breaks the marital ring inserted into the horn during the wedding ceremony. 
$\quad$This is the only case in which it can be removed, as the ring is heated and welded shut after being placed. A Viara Du'ul kobold with a broken horn will never re-marry, and will remain a widow for life.
### Info

Personality: 
$\quad$Adalyne contains a broiling and seething wrath within her that burns at her gut, eternal. Threatening to consume her, and everyone around her, it is only held captive by adamantine command over herself. Yet still it burns, unquenchable. 
$\quad$Even so, she gives her utmost to not let her wrath control nor define her soul. No matter how she might feel to be curt, or brusque, or even tactless. No matter her impatience. No matter the silence of her home, where once was so much joy. No matter how difficult it is to control that anger, when it feels she's being flayed from within, and make that decision to be kind.
$\quad$But the devil yet festers in still water.

Likes/Dislikes:
$\quad$She enjoys meditation and the art of making tea, but cannot stand to hear silence for any considerable length of time. She'll break the face of anyone who speaks negatively of her daughters.
#### Backstory

> [!EXAMPLE]- Childhood to Pre-Dragonfall
> When she was fourteen, Adalyne's mother assaulted her. Her father kicked the woman out of their house. 
> Three months later, a judge dismissed the case her father raised against the woman. "Not enough evidence," the judge said.
> Every attempt her father made at legal action ended the same way.
> 
> A year later, her mother came back, and dragged her father out of the house with the help of seven friends. He almost died from the attack; Adalyne stopped them. She cemented her status as a combative prodigy, at age fifteen, in a haze of red. Eight adults, arrayed against one child. 
> 
> Adalyne killed them. 
> 
> That was the day she manifested her first conceptual element; she asked herself, what did it mean to be strong?
> "Not this."
> 
> At age nineteen Adalyne joined the local magi police force; this was before the ATDF was formed. She flew up the ranks as the years passed, on the rails laid for her by her father. Rails laid during late nights spent studying tactics and days spent sparring with her father. 
> Steeped in the rising counterculture of her region from her days in school, Adalyne unintentionally became a figurehead of revolution in a region where matriarchy and misandry had been the norm for generations. 
> All she ever wanted to do was help the people around her.
> 
> Her strength and experience grew as if it would never stop. At some point, she can't say when, she began fighting more political battles than on the field. She thought she was carving her own path forward. At some point, she became the equivalent of a regional Bishop. 
> 
> At some point, she began to ask herself if she ever really wanted this. 
> 
> More battles and more victories passed in a gray haze. She lost the will to, as she'd seen it before, "fight the good fight." So many interviews, so many arguments, so many attacks. The endless political nonsense grated at her until she couldn't take it anymore, and she stopped fighting on the political front.
> 
> Then she met Absalem.
> He was from the same clan as her; they'd went to school together, even been friends, only he'd moved away. He was in the proto-ATDF of a nearby region, the two different forces working together to tackle the rise of a demonic cult between the two areas.
> They fell in love. In time, he transferred back to their home region. They got married. It's as if his just being there burned away the fog that had settled over her mind. She was happy; truly, for the first time in years. She began "fighting the good fight" again, speaking out for outdated, bigoted legislature to be appealed or reworked. Adalyne was determined and on the path to win once and for all.
> 
> Then someone tried to kill Absalem.
> 
> Someone tried to kill her husband.
> 
> In time, she became pregnant. Adalyne asked herself, why should she put her family, her child at risk for this vile, bigoted, backwater clan? She couldn't answer. They left for Dragonfall.
> She wept when the cross on her tattoo turned from white to black. 
> But she never looked back.



> [!EXAMPLE]+ Post-Dragonfall
>Moving to Dragonfall brought with it one of the most hectic periods of Adalyne's life, but in a good way. Between acclimating to an entirely new culture, so radically different from what had been her norm; adjusting to the new language, which her husband had far more experience in; and now becoming a mother; 
>Adalyne was busier in those months than the entire rest of her life. 
> 
>Some day, she woke up, and reality at last set in.
>For the first time, it felt real.
For the first time she realized the shadows, which had plagued her for so long, were gone. Her husband no longer had need to carry a weapon at all times. 
She no longer had need to be ever vigilant.
Her son, her beautiful baby boy, would never know the darkness within those dreadful old stone walls.
>
>Adalyne was at peace. 
> 
>It all fucking fell apart in 709, in Blaise's first year at DFMA. It always had to.
>It was inevitable.
>
>Absalem's birthday had been four days away. She was pregnant. He had always wanted a little girl. It would've been perfect. It would've been too perfect. So of course it couldn't be allowed to happen.
> 
 Mother and child came home to a horror of torn flesh and broken bones. Cold blood pooled on the kitchen floor. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move. It was so quiet. The entire left side of his skull had been caved in, shards of bone and brain matter spread across the floor in a befouling halo. She held her breath and waited for it to stop. His sword was broken. Metal dotted the floor, shaved off bit by bit. The broken and battered blade laid beside his leg, broken bone piercing the flesh parallel with the blade. The smell of blood filled her head. She held her breath and waited for it to stop.
> The floor rose to meet her. 
>
>What other course was available to her? 
>The demon killed her husband.
>To take revenge against the man which had sealed it away in Cerberus Keep, the demon killed her husband. The demon killed the light of her life. Nevermore will she hear his singing; nevermore know his reassurance; nevermore feel his touch.
>Absalem, oh Absalem.
>
>The demon took part of her soul and sold it to the reaper for his revenge. 
>What other course could there be for her?
>
>She's already dug two graves.
>Adalyne will take her own revenge.






### Magic Name: Wrath of The World
OC Using this magic: Adalyne Corbin
Overall place in type triad: Offensive
**Elemental Properties** 
Strength(Earth), Speed(Water), Might(Lightning)
> [!EXAMPLE]- Racial Perk: Dorraul Markana
>$\quad$Adalyne's arcane tattoos. Kobold magi of several specific species can be born with them. They are a direct interface between magic and biology, growing with a mage as they age and develop. These markings have a metallic appearance.
>
>$\quad$Adalyne has exceedingly large markana, covering extensive portions of her arms, legs, and collarbone. The markings on her arms consist of red spirals with black outlines, with a white cross on the outside of her right forearm; on her legs, interwoven emerald green bands with black outlines. The last, on her collarbone, is defined by thin flowing blue bands that meet at her sternum; in the middle of them, over her sternum, there is a small portion of Adalyne's flesh that has crystallized.
>$\quad$This interfacing of biology with her Conceptual Elements has led to the creation of Boris and Ilja, which are manifestations of her Strength and Speed elements respectively. They are summons directly bound to the markana on her arms and legs. Summoning them prevents her from using their respective element entirely until they return to her and join back again to their respective tattoo, which effectively act as their housing. 
#### Description
Over time, Adalyne "lost" her Psychic affinity; or perhaps rather, what was once a Psychic affinity matured into a Lightning affinity as she exited retirement. Regardless, in addition to clearing her rust & re-establishing control over her base elements, Adalyne possesses control over Lightning.

$\quad$Now, much of her magic revolves around her elemental cloaks. By a specific encoding technique, she has instilled the essence of each cloak into specific techniques, empowering and simultaneously locking them behind each cloak. 
Transforming from "base" into a Cloak is instantaneous; however, any change in state incurs a <small>**three turn cool-down**</small> before she can do so again. In addition to this if a spell bound to a Cloak is active, and she changes states, <small>**all effects of that spell will immediately end.**</small> 

$\quad$The aspect Adalyne has chosen to embody with her (admittedly rudimentary) Zen magic is The World. 

$\quad$Be aware, several spells have additional information attached to them. These include:
- Cooldown, abbreviated "CD", before a spell can be used again
- Effect Period, abbreviated "EP", or how long the effect of a spell lasts
- Cast time, abbreviated "CT", or how long a spell must be charged before it can be used

> [!EXAMPLE]- A note on Might
>$\quad$Over the past 17 years, Adalyne has been ceaseless in the development of her magic. She *should* have 'understood' her two Conceptual Elements as much as she could, as she had achieved the highest grade cloak with both. This would not be the case for long.
>Shortly after Blaise's hospitalization at the hands of Neloth, Adalyne comprehended something further: "Strength" and "Speed", or her understanding of both, combined to bring forth "Might", a 'second grade' Conceptual Element in that it is derived from other Conceptual Element(s) and thus literally "larger" in scope (though this does not make it inherently better.)
>$\quad$Might is the Conceptual Element of insurmountable force and change, causing uncontrollable rage in its wielders; that is, *nigh*-uncontrollable, as Adalyne asserted control over it and changed GOMA's definition of the element. 
>Adalyne is the only currently known Might user who has done this.

#### Techniques
> [!TIP]+ Tome of Strength
><small>**[Boris] (Summon | Strength)**</small> 
>$\quad$Boris is the first of Adalyne's two summons. Housed within the markana on her arms, Boris is the manifestation of her Strength element; When he is on the field, she loses all access to it. However, Boris may be on the field while Adalyne is in a different cloak. 
>If Boris is defeated in battle, he will instantly return to Adalyne's body and she will lose all access to Strength magic for 24 hours, which is the time it takes for Boris to recover his strength,
>$\quad$Boris's appearance is like that of a direwolf, constructed of scarlet energy, with a shoulder height of 4'8" and a body length of 10' 8".
>$\quad$
>$\quad$In addition to, and because of, his sheer size Boris's physical prowess is immense. His jaws are capable of ripping through solid steel, and his headbutt is able to deform actively charged, high-grade catalyst alloys. His tail is able to be used as a club or as a shield.
>$\quad$On top of his destructive capabilities Boris is deceptively mobile; he *is* physically fast, but it goes much further than that. Boris is capable of rapid forward and backward movement thanks to a technique of his own invention, *Makhnami*, which allows him to close or create even vast distances before immediately going on the offensive or defensive. 
>$\quad$It should be noted, he can only do this forward and backward, and is vulnerable if caught unaware in the middle of it.
> $\quad$
> <small>**[Cloak of Strength] (State Transformation | Strength) {Perfect Grade}**</small>
> $\quad$Upon activation Adalyne is enveloped in a flamelike aura of scarlet, flecked with <small>**golden embers**</small>. This aura hovers 2-3 inches from her body, and itself has no apparent effect on surroundings (including attackers.) 
> $\quad$Adalyne, after much hard work and many hours of meditation, her body has acclimated to the elevated state, and can maintain it indefinitely without any loss in stamina. It should be noted that this is exclusive to [Cloak of Strength]. Because of that, she has dubbed this "Perfect Grade." 
> $\quad$
> $\quad$While in this state, Adalyne's physical strength is vastly increased. Her deadlifting PB (with her magic suppressed) is 520 pounds; with [Cloak of Strength] however, her deadlifting PB (simulated with VAKTOVIA[^3]) currently sits at ~1,915 pounds. However this state incurs an expansion of muscle mass, and thus, decreased mobility when it comes to larger movements.
> Considering this, [Cloak of Strength] sees the most usage whenever Adalyne needs to hold down a specific area. 
> $\quad$ Spells requiring this to be active will be marked with <small>**{STR}**</small>.
>
> <small>**[Crushing Mass] (Hex | Strength&Earth) {CD: 12 turns | EP: 8 turns} STR}**</small>
> $\quad$Adalyne strikes the spiked butt of her poleaxe into the ground, generating a shockwave of magic that travels 15 meters in all directions; every entity hit by this shockwave that Adalyne deems an enemy will then be inflicted with [Crushing Mass]. This shockwave ignores physical obstacles that may be in the way, but arcane barriers can stop it. The effects are three-fold:
> - Any entity capable of flight (through any means) inflicted with [Crushing Mass] will immediately lose the ability to do so. Those currently in flight will fall out of the sky.
> - The effect of enemy movement-focused abilities are (mildly) reduced.
> - At the point Adalyne strikes the ground, an Anchor of congealed Strength magic is formed. All entities inflicted with [Crushing Mass], as well as Adalyne, are bound to a 15 meter diameter sphere around this spike. Because the initial casting range is larger than this, anyone who is caught outside of this range will be immediately (and violently) pulled into it. 
 > This specific effect can be dispelled by destroying the Anchor; [Crushing Mass] itself will remain until it expires or is forcibly cleansed from a target. The anchor cannot be reformed outside of a full re-cast. <small>**There is a maximum force that the Anchor can put on any single entity;**</small> if this force is exceeded, the Anchor's hold on that entity will break and they will no longer be bound.
> $\quad$
> <small>**[Foundation] (Passive | Earth) {STR}**</small>
> $\quad$While [Cloak of Strength] is active Adalyne has an innate, arcane connection to the ground beneath her feet. While she's grounded it's much harder for an opponent to do things such as move her or destabilize her. Generally, if she wants to stay in a position, she's *going* to stay in that position.
> $\quad$Adalyne also has far more control over surrounding terrain thanks to this connection, be it dirt, rock, cement, or brick. Earthen constructs will generally be more durable.
>- <small>**[Hold the Line] (Buff | Earth) {CD: None | EP: None} {STR}**</small>
> $\quad$Adalyne bangs a fist on her chest and roars. Her magic resonates with allies within 20 meters, extending to them a lesser version of its stabilization. If any affected allies have Earth, or an Earth-based element, they will receive [Foundation]'s full effects.
> $\quad$This effect will last as long as Adalyne maintains [Cloak of Strength].
> $\quad$
> <small>**[Resonant Redirection] (Def. | STR}) {CT: 1 tr | CD: 8 tr | EP: 4 tr} {ZEN}**</small>
> $\quad$Resonant Redirection must be charged and prepared a turn before use, and can be held for 4 turns before it expires. Adalyne focuses magic into her poleaxe, causing it to shine red for a few seconds. With correct timing, Adalyne blocks an attack and releases the charge.
> $\quad$The kinetic energy of the attack will be perfectly redirected. In the case of a projectile, this will cause it to be sent back to its source with the exact same speed. The type of the attack being redirected is very important: Some, for example beam attacks, cannot be redirected at all. 
> $\quad$If it is imbued with extraplanar magic weak to her Earth element, the redirected attack will never miss and entirely ignore her opponents elemental resistances. If it is instead resistant, redirection will fail entirely.

> [!TIP]+ Tome of Speed
> **<small>[Ilya] (Summon | Speed)</small>**
>$\quad$
>**<small>[Speed Cloak] (State Transformation | Speed) 3rd Grade</small>**
>$\quad$Upon activation, Adalyne is engulfed in a verdant flame-like aura, extending four to five inches from her body. This aura is purely visual, a by-product Adalyne hasn't taken the time to stamp out. 
>$\quad$This state heightens Adalyne's mobility considerably including her overall speed as well as dexterity, allowing her to be at the right place, at the right time, all the time. 
>In testing, on flat ground in a straight line, Adalyne has a 0-to-96 KPH time of eight seconds; her sprint PB rests at 10 km in three-and-a-half minutes, with her highest speed at 165 KPH. 
>While not able to maintain such high speeds at all times, testing on standardized agility courses shows high levels of maneuverability.
>$\quad$
><small>**[Blade of Volos] (Attack | Water) {CD: 2 tr} {SPD}**</small>
>$\quad$While [Speed Cloak] is active, Adalyne has the ability to fire projectiles of water from her polearm; the shape of the projectile, and its properties, depend on which part they originate from. 
>$\quad$The axhead of her poleaxe will fire blades of water (obvious enough,) which have a limited range (8m); the spike at the top will fire beams of water, which have less power but greater range (12m); the hammer/beak will fire short range (4m) spikes of water which are better for breaking through defenses, arcane and mundane.
>
><small>**[](Defense | Speed) {SPD}**</small>
