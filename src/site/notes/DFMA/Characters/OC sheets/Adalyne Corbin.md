##### Physical description
$\quad$Adalynes form is the result of 17 years of ceaseless, fervid training. Her adherence to her diet, her commitment to the evolution of her magic, and her devotion to the cultivation of her fighting ability can only be described as zealous and frenzied. 
$\quad$Her body reflects this, in every aspect. 
$\quad$She looks like a woman who has picked heavy things up, put them down again, and then done that a few tens of billions of times over the past 17 or so years.

$\quad$Adalyne possesses a large pair of ram-esque horns, made of a dark gray type of keratin. The tip of her right horn is broken off. This was purposeful and self-inflicted:
$\quad$It is the custom of the Viara Du'ul clan, that any who become a widow do such to themselves— This breaks the marital ring inserted into the horn during the wedding ceremony. 
$\quad$This is the only case in which it can be removed, as the ring is heated and welded shut after being placed. A Viara Du'ul kobold with a broken horn will never re-marry, and will remain a widow for life.
### Info

Personality: 
$\quad$Adalyne contains a broiling and seething wrath within her that burns at her gut, eternal. Threatening to consume her, and everyone around her, it is only held captive by adamantine command over herself. Yet still it burns, unquenchable. 
$\quad$Even so, she gives her utmost to not let her wrath control nor define her soul. No matter how she might feel to be curt, or brusque, or even tactless. No matter her impatience. No matter the silence of her home, where once was so much joy. No matter how difficult it is to control that anger, when it feels she's being flayed from within, and make that decision to be kind.
$\quad$But the devil yet festers in still water.

Likes/Dislikes:
$\quad$She enjoys meditation and the art of making tea, but cannot stand to hear silence for any considerable length of time. She'll break the face of anyone who speaks negatively of her daughters.
#### Backstory

> [!EXAMPLE]- Childhood to Pre-Dragonfall
> When she was fourteen, Adalyne's mother assaulted her. Her father kicked the woman out of their house. 
> Three months later, a judge dismissed the case her father raised against the woman. "Not enough evidence," the judge said.
> Every attempt her father made at legal action ended the same way.
> 
> A year later, her mother came back, and dragged her father out of the house with the help of seven friends. He almost died from the attack; Adalyne stopped them. She cemented her status as a combative prodigy, at age fifteen, in a haze of red. Eight adults, arrayed against one child. 
> 
> Adalyne killed them. 
> 
> That was the day she manifested her first conceptual element; she asked herself, what did it mean to be strong?
> "Not this."
> 
> At age nineteen Adalyne joined the local magi police force; this was before the ATDF was formed. She flew up the ranks as the years passed, on the rails laid for her by her father. Rails laid during late nights spent studying tactics and days spent sparring with her father. 
> Steeped in the rising counterculture of her region from her days in school, Adalyne unintentionally became a figurehead of revolution in a region where matriarchy and misandry had been the norm for generations. 
> All she ever wanted to do was help the people around her.
> 
> Her strength and experience grew as if it would never stop. At some point, she can't say when, she began fighting more political battles than on the field. She thought she was carving her own path forward. At some point, she became the equivalent of a regional Bishop. 
> 
> At some point, she began to ask herself if she ever really wanted this. 
> 
> More battles and more victories passed in a gray haze. She lost the will to, as she'd seen it before, "fight the good fight." So many interviews, so many arguments, so many attacks. The endless political nonsense grated at her until she couldn't take it anymore, and she stopped fighting on the political front.
> 
> Then she met Absalem.
> He was from the same clan as her; they'd went to school together, even been friends, only he'd moved away. He was in the proto-ATDF of a nearby region, the two different forces working together to tackle the rise of a demonic cult between the two areas.
> They fell in love. In time, he transferred back to their home region. They got married. It's as if his just being there burned away the fog that had settled over her mind. She was happy; truly, for the first time in years. She began "fighting the good fight" again, speaking out for outdated, bigoted legislature to be appealed or reworked. Adalyne was determined and on the path to win once and for all.
> 
> Then someone tried to kill Absalem.
> 
> Someone tried to kill her husband.
> 
> In time, she became pregnant. Adalyne asked herself, why should she put her family, her child at risk for this vile, bigoted, backwater clan? She couldn't answer. They left for Dragonfall.
> She wept when the cross on her tattoo turned from white to black. 
> But she never looked back.



> [!EXAMPLE]+ Post-Dragonfall
>Moving to Dragonfall brought with it one of the most hectic periods of Adalyne's life, but in a good way. Between acclimating to an entirely new culture, so radically different from what had been her norm; adjusting to the new language, which her husband had far more experience in; and now becoming a mother; 
>Adalyne was busier in those months than the entire rest of her life. 
> 
>Some day, she woke up, and reality at last set in.
>For the first time, it felt real.
For the first time she realized the shadows, which had plagued her for so long, were gone. Her husband no longer had need to carry a weapon at all times. 
She no longer had need to be ever vigilant.
Her son, her beautiful baby boy, would never know the darkness within those dreadful old stone walls.
>
>Adalyne was at peace. 
> 
>It all fucking fell apart in 709, in Blaise's first year at DFMA. It always had to.
>It was inevitable.
>
>Absalem's birthday had been four days away. She was pregnant. He had always wanted a little girl. It would've been perfect. It would've been too perfect. So of course it couldn't be allowed to happen.
> 
> Mother and child came home to a horror of torn flesh and broken bones. Cold blood pooled on the kitchen floor. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move. It was so quiet. The entire left side of his skull had been caved in, shards of bone and brain matter spread across the floor in a befouling halo. She held her breath and waited for it to stop. His sword was broken. Metal dotted the floor, shaved off bit by bit. The broken and battered blade laid beside his leg, broken bone piercing the flesh parallel with the blade. The smell of blood filled her head. She held her breath and waited for it to stop.
> The floor rose to meet her. 
> $\quad$
>What other course was available to her? 
>The demon killed her husband.
>To take revenge against the man which had sealed it away in Cerberus Keep, the demon killed her husband. The demon killed the light of her life. Nevermore will she hear his singing; nevermore know his reassurance; nevermore feel his touch.
>Absalem, oh Absalem.
>
>The demon took part of her soul and sold it to the reaper for his revenge. 
>What other course could there be for her?
>
>She's already dug two graves.
>Adalyne will take her own revenge.



### ✦ Magic Name: Wrath of The World
Overall place in type triad: Offense 
Elemental Properties: Strength(Earth), Speed(Water)
> [!example]- Racial Perk: Dorraul Markana
>$\quad$Adalyne's arcane tattoos. Kobold magi of several specific species can be born with them. They are a direct interface between magic and biology, developing with the mage throughout life. These markings have a metallic appearance.
>
>$\quad$Adalyne has exceedingly large markana, covering extensive portions of her arms, legs, and collarbone. The markings on her arms consist of red spirals with black outlines, with a white cross on the outside of her right forearm; on her legs, interwoven emerald green bands with black outlines. The last, on her collarbone, is defined by thin flowing black bands that meet at her sternum; in the middle of them, over her sternum, there is a small portion of Adalyne's flesh that has crystallized.
#### ¶ Description
Adalyne's two cloaks or "states" form the foundation of her magic and combat. She's spent 15 years shaking off rust from her retirement, bringing her (very nearly) back to her prime years prior to the founding of the ATDF. 
Changing cloaks is instantaneous, but incurs a 6 turn cool-down. This is also a "ramp up" period: Both cloaks, when activated, require 4 turns to reach full strength. 
Changing cloaks disables ongoing spells reliant on that cloak, in most cases.

It should be noted, Adalyne's manifestations of **Strength** and **Speed** require **pre-existing** physical medium to exist: Techniques such as magic constructs are impossible.

> [!EXAMPLE]- On the Design of the Twins
> The Twins, Artem and Ilya, are a pair of familiars uniquely bound to Adalyne. Their spirits fractured off from her soul sometime during her depressive episode, following Absalem's death. Being spirits of **Strength** and **Speed** which cannot exist without pre-existing physical medium, they had no physical form of their own and had to have bodies built for them.
> Their bodies are made from a Catalystic variant of Damascus steel, crafted with the bone ash of a direwolf. They each have a shoulder height of 40" and a body length of 70".
> When not active, their physical bodies are stored inside their respective Markana: Artem in the Red Markana on her arms, and Ilya in the Green Markana on Adalyne's legs.
> To summon either familiar, Adalyne must sacrifice access to that element for as long as they are on the field. So long as either twin is within 3m of Adalyne, they can be reverse-summoned into the Markana which houses them. 
> If at any point they are defeated in combat, they will be immediately reverse-summoned, and Adalyne will lose access to their respective element for 24 turns.

#### ¶ Techniques
**» Strength Cloak** (Self || Strength) 
> Adalyne is engulfed in a scarlet, flamelike aura flecked with golden embers, extending 2-3 inches from her body. This aura is purely visual. No physical effect on surroundings is present, but it is warm to the touch. 
> She has perfected, and acclimated to, the elevated state: she can maintain **Strength Cloak** indefinitely without any loss in stamina.
> $\quad$
> Her physical strength and durability in this state cannot be overstated. Her best deadlift using **Strength Cloak** currently stands at 901kg. Adalyne *can* move quickly in a straight line, however due to the increase in muscle mass mobility is generally decreased.
> **µ Subjugation** (Hex || Strength)
>> Adalyne strikes down with her poleaxe and channels **Strength** into the ground. At once, four small rocks are imbued with the element and rise into the air, and float idly around her. These projectiles deal minimal damage, but inflict the **Subjugation** hex on contact. They have two methods for usage.
>> Adalyne has the ability to simply hit one with her poleaxe to send it flying at an enemy. However she can "lock onto" an enemy to turn it into a homing projectile by focusing on them and maintaining line-of-sight for three turns; once locked on and fired it cannot be avoided, only destroyed.
>> **Subjugation** lasts for 8 turns. The hex debuffs movement-focused techniques substantially, and disables flying abilities if present; gliding at reduced speeds may be possible. Once used, **Subjugation** cannot be cast again for 12 turns. 
>> Active projectiles become inert if **Strength Cloak** is deactivated; the hex, if already inflicted, will continue for its usual duration.

**» Artem** (Defense || Strength) 
> As the avatar of **Strength**, Artem is incredibly durable. His role is to absorb damage intended for his allies and he has two abilities to fulfill it.
> He also possesses a tertiary ability allowing him to manipulate the size and shape of his tail, which can be used offensively or defensively. 
> **µ Overshield** (Defense || Strength.)
>> The first ability is **Overshield**, allowing him to increase his physical defense through two methods. Every turn he spends on the field, Artem will passively absorb a trickle of energy from the surroundings to bolster his defense. The second method is found in his fangs; when he bites down on an opponent, he will leach magic from them. Only a certain amount of magic can be stolen with each attack. Stolen energy is immediately committed to his defense in the same turn.
> 
> **µ Vortex** (Passive || Strength)
>> His second ability is **Vortex**. It's a passive ability with a range of 30m centered around him. All attacks considered to be projectiles, when intended for his allies, will be pulled toward Artem instead.

**» Speed Cloak** (Self || Speed)
> The physical appearance is identical to **Strength Cloak**, only it is verdant instead of scarlet. Also unlike **Strength Cloak**, it cannot be maintained indefinitely without loss in stamina.
> $\quad$
> The effect is also like the other, only while **Speed Cloak** is active, Adalyne can move at high speeds while maintaining extreme mobility. She is able to navigate tight passageways, such as alleys, and make sharp turns without slowing down. Adalyne can run 1500 meters in 0:27.55 while in **Speed Cloak**.
> **µ Maelstrom** (Offense || Speed)
>> Adalyne touches a pre-existing body of water with her poleaxe and channels **Speed** into it, causing some number of water orbs to float idly around her. She can create anywhere between four and twelve orbs. These act as ammunition for **Maelstrom**.
>> Adalyne can touch any part of her poleaxe to one of the orbs to use it; to different results. Using the spike will fire a pressurized beam of water, a piercing attack with a range of 15 meters; the poleaxe blade will fire a 2m wide slash, which has a range of 9 meters.

**» Ilya** (Support || Speed)
>  As the avatar of **Speed**, Ilya's role is to harass the enemy and control area. While she is incredibly fast, her physical defense pales in comparison to her brother Artem's; combined with her low direct damage, she will fold if too much attention is directed her way.
>  **µ Venomous Touch** (Support || Speed)
>> Any damage dealt to an enemy via **physical contact** with Ilya inflicts this hex. This includes bites from her fangs, scratches from her claws, or blunt damage from her body.
>> **Venomous Touch** lasts for 3 turns. For its duration, the magic control of the afflicted is dampened; spells become more expensive and less precise. For its duration, the afflicted's concentration is disrupted. Spells **requiring concentration** become impossible until the effect clears.
>
> **µ Corrupted Ground** (Support || Speed)
>> Once every 7 turns, Ilya can corrupt up to a 15m² area with her **Venomous Touch**. This effect will endure until: she is defeated, or reverse-summoned; the area is moved by her, or is forcibly cleansed by another character. Remaining in area controlled by **Corrupted Ground** will prevent the hex from clearing or being cleansed, but the duration (upon leaving Corrupted Ground) will not exceed 3 turns.


### ✦ Gear
#### ¶ BFAS
Elemental properties: **Strength** & **Speed**
Catalyst: **Y**
##### µ Functional Description
> Adalyne's armor, titled BFAS for "Ballistic Full-plate Armor System." It consists of 4 layers, from outermost to innermost: Ceramic plates, metal full-plate, kevlar, and cloth padding. All these layers are heavily saturated with magic: the ceramic and metal plates with Earth magic, the kevlar & cloth layers with Water magic. 
> The armor system is heavily enchanted, and each layer is equipped with its own wards. The wards can be described as buckets, which can absorb a certain amount of damage before failing and needing to be regenerated. 
> 
> The Ceramic layer is warded to absorb penetrative force, and heavily saturated with Earth magic to absorb Lightning based attacks. The Metal layer is also Earth saturated. The Kevlar layer is also warded to absorb penetrative force. Finally, the Cloth padding layer is warded to absorb blunt or concussive force; these two innermost layers are also saturated with Water magic, helping protect Adalyne from Fire magic & prevent her from overheating naturally. 
> The armor system can draw on Adalyne's magic to repair itself. She also has the ability to store the armor in her Markana when not in use, and summon it into place at will.
##### µ Physical Description
> BFAS does not sport much ornamentation, only a bare minimum required to represent the ATDF Suit which she is part of: the chest is magically dyed with the logo of the ATDF, and the helmet is dyed with some yellow accents.
> The helmet does not appear to have holes for her to see, but it is enchanted to be see-through from the inside. Her voice is also magically carried, causing a slight amplified echo effect. Air management is also handled magically.

#### ¶ Poleaxe
Elemental properties: **Strength** & **Speed**
Catalyst: **Y**

##### µ Description
> Can be stored in Adalyne's Markana and summoned at will.
