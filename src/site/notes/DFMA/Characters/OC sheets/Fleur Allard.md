| **Fox Animalian**, blind, with natural red markings on the inside of his ears. These completely cover the insides of his ears, seeming to be fashioned after sacred geometry. He carries a staff at all times.  His eyes are complemented by rust red markings on his eyebrows and framed by his waist-length onyx black hair, the same color as his fur. He often braids it with magic, or keeps it in a bun using a simple **hair stick** like the one displayed here.<br>Wherever Fleur goes, the *click-clack* of his wooden sandals and the soft ringing of the bells on his staff accompany him. | ![il_570xN.png](/img/user/DFMA/Characters/OC%20sheets/il_570xN.png) |

### ✦ Info

#### ¶ Personality:
Fleur can be quiet or loud depending on the situation and there's little or no in-between. One of the reasons he has bells on his staff is people can lose track of him without them, despite his insistence that he had no idea how it kept happening he eventually added bells to make everyone's lives easier. He actually quite likes them now. Fleur prefers being on his own track at his own pace; he has his way of doing things that works for him, both in general and as a professor. He does not need help... most of the time.

**Likes/Dislikes**: 
Fluer likes the sound of people. It's a bit difficult to describe and not sound silly, but... there's a lot to hear, if you really take the time and put in the effort to listen. Fleur is not a fan of silence or solitude, and he *would* need a noise machine to sleep if he didn't already hear everything electrical around him anyway. He loves nature and hates cars. He likes talking. He likes it a lot. What he really hates is people who dominate the conversation and barely let anyone else get a word in, or don't take you seriously. 
Do not initiate physical contact. 
The last guy who tried to pat him on the head left an imprint in the wall and received several broken bones. Please do not the fox.
