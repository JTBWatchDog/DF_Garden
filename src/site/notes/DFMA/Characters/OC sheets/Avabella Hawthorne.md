### ✦ Info

Personality: 
Avabella has grown quieter over the years, the brashness of youth having gave way to shrewdness, transformed by the weathering sands of time. Yet she's still not very patient. Yet she's still loud. Yet her spirit still burns fiercely, unquenchable; Yet, she is wounded.
Avabella likes to keep people at arm's length; more than this though, what she wants most is to prevent that which happened to her from happening to others.
Likes/Dislikes:
Nowadays she can be alone without being uncomfortable, sometimes she prefers privacy to company, if not all the time. Nowadays her social battery is just smaller. Once upon a time she wanted to have company 24/7, but not anymore. She hates clingy people and being rushed. She can't stand people pleasers. 

#### ¶ Backstory
Her twin brother Logan was the only Hawthorne kid of their generation that matched her in intellect; prodigal twins, of equal level. Each displayed an affinity for magic early on, Ava to fire and Logan to electricity. 
The proficiency for fire she displayed was uncanny. When she was five there was a period where she could only be handled by an older cousin of hers, another fire mage, because she burst into flames upwards of thirty times a day.
She was properly evaluated at the age of 9 and the Hawthornes, collectively, decided such an intense elemental affinity hadn't shown itself within the family for several generations.

Also at the age of 9, she began expressing interest in Arcana Augere. Interest became dedication. Next year the incident with Simon, one of her cousins whom she and Logan were particularly close with, happened. Dedication became obsession.
Her study of the theory behind Arcana Augere became fervent.
At the age of 14, she became the youngest ever recorded to safely and stably maintain the technique out of combat.

She enrolled at DFMA when she was 17, in the same year as her brother. Unlike her brother, she pursued a double major in the Combat Prowess Program and Somatic Arcane Theory. She graduated with a Master's in both in AE682, two years before Logan, at 22. After Ava's graduation in AE692, the ATDF recruited her immediately, where she would stay in a Dragonfall-centric diagonal unlike Logan; he left for specialized training abroad and would only return eight years later. It was like she had (temporarily) lost her other half. 
That was rough.

Not too much of note happened while he was away, being honest. Things, got, boring. Yeah, she got stronger, got better and stuff. She was put to work by the ATDF. But it wasn't as fulfilling without him, so she thought at the time. It never really came up, but she kind of resented him a little bit for it... But that was then. That was before their relationship got much, much worse.
Fast forward almost seventeen years. You aren't missing much. It's Winter of AE710. Logan has long since returned, Ignis' attack on Dragonfall happened last year and Logan has succeeded Alessia as a Rook.

Avabella is now a Bishop of his diagonal. He always was better at strategy, she at tactics, and she was fine with that. She was fine with that at the time, anyway. She's getting ahead of herself. It's December 15th, the coldest day Dragonfall had seen that year. 
For the past two months, the city had been plagued by the plot of some demonic cult. At the time, they estimated it had anywhere between ten and thirty members. Disappearances, ritualistic murders, among other gruesome crimes. The bodies could best be described as corrupted and defiled. It was not a sight for anyone with a weak stomach. Hazmat teams were the only ones cleared to go within six feet of a discovered case; it didn't *seem* to spread, but that wasn't a chance anyone wanted to take least of all Logan, who was still quite a recently appointed Rook. The cult's capabilities still weren't truly known.

They had narrowed down the cult's base of operations to four possible locations. Surveillance began. Then, they had narrowed it down to one.  It's still not known how, but the cult caught on. Somehow, the cult knew they were watching. At 4 in the morning, some 30 people entered the base; this was more than enough to raise alarms. Even an hour later, nobody had come out of the building.
So, at 6 in the morning, Logan and his diagonal struck.

The operation started out fine. A lot of the cultists weren't magi, wielding (presumably) enchanted weapons that still couldn't penetrate their armor. Those that were, were C or D rank. Nothing unexpected; threats like these always folded when they met direct opposition. Logan believed, justifiably so, this would be the limit of the threat. They proceeded under this supposition.
As for the base, it was nothing unprecedented. Stereotypical, really, until they got deeper in.
They had dug beneath the foundation of the building. Beneath it, Logan said he couldn't sense anything: it was a complete null zone. There wasn't time to neutralize it, he said. After all, they were clearly up to something. It would be safer to stop it sooner rather than later, he said.
However, without his sensory abilities, Logan decided it would be best if he didn't take point going into the null zone, and Ava should take point instead. 

That was their first mistake, and it's on both of them really. He was shaken by it, being blind, not able to be three steps ahead like he always was. Even if she didn't recognize it back then, seeing him like that unsettled her too. It wasn't really the time or place to question him either; that was her thinking at the time.
It was a disaster.

A spiraling stairwell carved down through the foundation and the earth, barely large enough at any point for one person, for fifty feet maybe. At the bottom, it opened into a large chamber.
Contained therein; surrounded by the cult, and half of them dead; was a demon.

There was no way they could have known what lied in wait for them.
There in the center of the chamber, was an incomplete but unbound manifestation of the greater demon Flauros.

It took a form like a humanoid leopard, made of flames the color of malachite. Its limbs were long and and thin. Its claws — and the eyes likewise — burned white, iridescent like an oily film, hissing and bubbling with alchemical fire. With its wings like the brittle leaves of a dead tree it covered its narrow and starved abdomen. 

It looked to her. It spoke to her. 

The demons voice was like the wind, not quite sound, whispering across barren salted soil. 
And the word of the demon was desolation. 
She fell to her knees. What it said to her, she would not ever be able to recall. 

It lunged. Ensnared by the demon as they were, nobody moved to help her, not even Logan. Not even Logan, the *only* one of them she was supposed to be able to rely on in that moment. When everyone else was frozen, *he* should've been able to do something. But he didn't.
The only person who saved her, was herself. She barely moved in time to save her life, but every day she still feels where Flauros' claws ran through her face. Every day, she still must tend to and clean the wounds which refuse to heal.
She doesn't remember much more of that day.

Ava spent a year in the hospital. She refused to see Logan. Every healing attempt failed. Immediately upon leaving the hospital, she resigned from the ATDF. She hasn't spoken to Logan since then.
Not very long after, she started seeking to become a Professor at DFMA.

### ✦ Magic Name: White Phoenix 
Overall place in type triad: Offense
Elemental Properties: Fire
#### ¶ Description
Ava is regarded as the current living master of the Hawthorne Wyrgcraeft ("hidden skill" or "cursed skill") **Arcana Augere**.  Its focus is to open the Anahata chakra, the heart, center of a human magi's arcane system, and take full control; by doing so, the magi can now pressurize their magic system. Under enough pressure, mana will begin exuding from their body; this is the aura. 
The usage of this aura is the foundation of all Augere magic, and is learned through three fundamental techniques to control pressure in the arcane system: **Regulation**, to bind the aura to its user and stop it from dissipating into the environment; **Suppression**, to be able to contain the aura within; **Enhancement**, to increase pressure either in specific areas or totally.
This pressure control is the second layer of foundation since now not only do spells consume mana, they require and consume a certain amount of pressure. This is measured in standardized "levels". Ava can handle a maximum of 12. 

With pressure, comes strain. Pressure can only be produced when the Anahata is working; the rate of work is measured in "Gears". Ava has access to four of them, numbered from 0 to 3. Higher gears grant faster pressurization but put more strain on the body; this strain is then measured in levels of "Heat." Beyond level 2, her stamina begins to degrade. Beyond level 6, she'll begin taking damage. 
If Avabella reaches a Heat level of 10, she will be immediately incapacitated as the pain becomes too much to bear; she will not be able to re-engage until she recovers.

> [!example]- Anahata Gears
> - **Gear 0**: Pressure will not increase, Heat will decrease by 1 every turn.
> - **Gear 1**: Pressure +1, Heat will not increase. 
> - **Gear 2**: Pressure +2, Heat +1. 
> - **Gear 3**: Pressure +3, Heat +2. In this Gear, Avabella's blood vessels visibly bulge beneath her skin.
#### ¶ Techniques

**» Aura Transmutation: First Blaze** (Defense, Offense | Fire)
> **Occupies three mainline slots.**
> Aura transmutation in Augere is simple at first glance, but deceptively difficult. The depth of understanding of the target element required to fundamentally change ones aura is staggering. However, once achieved, it is permanent.
> Avabella's fiery aura serves as both a passive defense and an offensive utility: she can use it as a source for all of her fire magic, improving efficiency. 
> Coupled with her excellent Regulation, this means she has rendered Augere's usual passive mana loss irrelevant.
> As Pressure increases the aura will burn hotter and brighter — white at level 12 — but it will always extend .3m from her body passively. Avabella has access to basic fire manipulation with a range of 6m. This also benefits from the efficiency boost of **First Blaze**. 
> 
> **µ Kickstart** (Self | Fire)
>> This can only be used when she first activates Arcana Augere. Upon activating Augere, she can choose whether or not to use **Kickstart**. This allows her to begin with level 4 Pressure instantly, at the cost of instantly creating 5 levels of Heat. Automatically puts her in Gear 2.
>
> **µ Fire Soul** (Offense | Fire)
>> Requires level 6 Pressure, consumes 4. 
>> Single target, must be charged for 2 turns during which she must keep the target in line of sight. Ava cannot use other spells while charging.
>> Creates a spiraling beam of fire 1m in diameter, which pursues the target relentlessly until it either hits or is destroyed.
>
> **µ Wall of Thorns** (Defense | Fire)
>> Requires level 4 Pressure, consumes 2. Walls require solid ground, and only one may exist at a time. Creating a new wall dispels the pre-existing one.
>> Ava creates a mana construct wall of fire; this is slightly different from simply creating a wall of fire, because it has tangible structure. It is, effectively, fire solidified into the shape of a dense wall of thorns. She can control the size and shape of it, up to a maximum width of 10m and height of 5m.
>
>**µ Flower Burst** (Offense | Fire)
>> Requires level 4 Pressure, consumes 4.
>> Using her aura as the source she creates 4 fireballs, each the size of a basketball. They'll spin around her idly, where she can fire them at will. Upon coming within 1m of an enemy target or hitting a surface, they'll explode with a radius of 2m. Only four may exist at a time. 
>
>**µ Phoenix Song** (Offense | Fire)
>> Requires level 2 Pressure, consumes 1.
>> The aura will disappear externally, as all of it is instead concentrated into her lungs. Her chest will visibly expand, before she unleashes a fire breath attack. She can focus it as she wills, either attacking a large area (6m long, 6m wide cone) or creating a highly pressurized stream of fire (10m long, 1m wide cone.) 
>> This attack can be used multiple times in rapid succession, but will be disabled for 3 turns after she stops concentrating her aura into her lungs. If used to create a continuous stream of fire, it will consume an extra level of Pressure for every additional turn.
>
>**µ Phoenix Power: Deflect** (Defense | Fire) 
>> Requires level 6 Pressure, consumes 2. Creates an extra level of Heat on use. Disabled for 3 turns after use.
>> Combining **Suppression** and **Enhancement**, Ava seals her aura within before releasing it from one of her limbs, creating an explosion. She can use this to deflect most attacks, regardless of type or element; though element *will* still be a factor generally, because of the sheer concussive force produced, it plays less of a role. It should be noted, **Deflect** has strict timing requirements on its use. If timed even slightly wrong it has the chance to fail. 
>
> **µ Gryndæmtigg: Polarity Inversion** (Defense, Support | N/E)
>> Requires Pressure below level 6, consumes none. Reduces Heat level by 2 on activation. 8 turn cooldown. 
>> Avabella roots herself to the spot and, with great focus, inverts the aura's polarity from "positive" to "negative" and hardens it. (It should be noted this isn't 100% accurate, but it remains the best way to summarize the theory behind Gryndæmtigg.) The First Blaze transmutation is, temporarily, undone; once the aura is hardened, it almost cannot be seen, and is only visible as a faint silver bubble.
>> This is not only a decently powerful defense, but because of the polarity inversion blocking attacks becomes a regenerative action. Blocking damage will reduce her Heat level, with greater effect against projectiles and a further boost against energy-based attacks. This allows her to reduce her Heat by up to 3 more levels on top of the initial 2. However, if the shield overloads and breaks, all 5 levels of Heat reduction will be lost. 


**» Pyra** (Offense | Fire)
**✦ BEHOLD THE PYRE UPON WHICH THE PHOENIX REINCARNATES | 14 DAY COOLDOWN** 
> **Pyra** can only be initiated when Avabella has maintained Pressure level 12 for two turns. 
> When it's activated Avabella will totally recover her physical stamina and the strain her body is under will melt away; her Heat level will be reset to 0. Energy wells from the depths of her soul; one fifth of her total mana capacity is restored. 
> For the next five turns Avabella is in a hyper-energized state, during which she will be able to access the subspells of **Pyra**. In addition, her body bursts at the seams with so much heat that her every movement (above a minimum speed) is followed by a shockwave of burning mana. Her every attack seems to hit twice. Enemies that narrowly avoid her blows will still be caught by the nigh-invisible heat waves.
> 
> This technique is not without consequences: After **Pyra** ends, she will be exhausted on a spiritual level and it cannot be used again for fourteen days. During this period, her max mana capacity will be reduced by one fourth and she can only produce a maximum Pressure level of 10. The maximum Heat level she can endure drops to 8. In addition, for 48 hours, healing magic will be half as effective on her. 
> 
> **µ Rupture** (Offense | Fire)
>> Requires level 6 Pressure, consumes 1 per use. 
>> Avabella creates and throws a hyper-condensed "spark" of mana. This spark travels 2 meters per second and, upon making contact with anything, explodes into a column of fire 2m in diameter and 10m tall. This pillar will endure for one full turn. She can use it up to 3 times per turn in this manner. 
>> It's also possible to hit one spark with a faster one. The resulting explosion is strong enough that a deafening shockwave will hit right before the primary blast, both with a radius of 10m.
>> Instead of throwing it, she may choose to crush the spark in her hand instead, with a similar result only the blast extends from her hand in front of her in a cone rather than a pillar. She can only use this variation once per turn.
>
> **µ Mystery of the First Blaze** (Defense | Fire)
> **✦ THE FEATHERS OF THE PHOENIX UNFURL THEN FOLD**
> **✦ A CLOAK TO FOOL THE WORLD** 
>> Resets Pressure to 0 and ends **Pyra** immediately after use. Charge time of 1 turn.
>> Ava erases any distinction between herself and her aura. For a brief moment, her body is transformed into pure heat energy and, in this state, her movement speed skyrockets. 
>> Once the Mystery of the First Blaze is activated, Avabella can intercept any "singular" attack and destroy it. In the case of melee, the attacker is knocked back with insurmountable force.
