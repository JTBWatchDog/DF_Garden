#### ¶ Backstory





### ✦ Magic Name: Gulthan Ūle
Overall place in type triad: Defense 
Elemental Properties: Lightning, Psychic
#### ¶ Description
Logan's expertise in Runic systems, namely Sadyarushk, is one of his greatest assets as a Rook. Theoretically, if left to his devices for long enough, Logan could create a runic matrix to solve any situation; in reality, not so much.
*One True Sense* and his runic expertise mesh together exceptionally well, allowing him to discern the functionality of enemy enchantments so as to counter them. 
His defensive capabilities, combined with his enhanced mobility, enable him to make sure everyone comes home alive.
#### ¶ Techniques
**» One True Sense** (Self, Passive || N/E)
	Logan has rewired his brain through extensive training and effort. The barriers between his senses have been broken, allowing them to overlap, combine, and even strengthen each other. This includes the five senses everyone knows as well as magic sensing, but also lesser known ones.
	A far more comprehensive perception of his surroundings is the end result. It may seem, to the outside observer, that Logan can see in all directions and even through walls but it's more complicated (and less extreme) than that.
	­
	Kinaesthesia and balance are amplified, making Logan far more resilient to disorienting spells. His acute magic senses overlap and amplify almost everything. Hearing, sight, pallesthesia (vibration sense), thermosensation, all combine and amplify the others.
	Not only does this combining strengthen each pathway of his perception, if an offensive spell closes off one of those pathways, Logan can continue on almost entirely unhindered.

	**µ Inborn Extrasensory Gift** (Self, Passive || N/E)
		From childhood, Logan has always seemed to know things he shouldn't. That's because, from childhood, he's always had an extremely acute ability to sense magic. So acute in fact that he knew his older cousin, Simon Hawthorne, was going to experience heart failure over a year before it happened.
		Nobody believed him.
		His extrasensory gift has only grown stronger with time and training. Now, if he knows the signature of a mage, he can pinpoint their exact location relative to him if they're uncloaked within 100 meters. Logan can also track magi through the magic residue their presence leaves behind.
