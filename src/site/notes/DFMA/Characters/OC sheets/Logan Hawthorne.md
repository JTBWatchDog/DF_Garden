Logan is very stocky with thick, powerful but not fully lean musculature. He also has a small forehead. His eyes are sharp and piercing, when not offset by a more pleasant expression. He often keeps his mid-back length hair in a french braid.

### ✦ Info
**Personality**: Logan is pragmatic and patient. However, when he gets the chance, he can be really fucking goofy. He's good at knowing the right time to crack a joke. He holds himself to the highest standard, but at the same time at least tries to avoid working himself to death. He knows very well what he is and isn't capable of; he just worries about the eventuality of him not being enough. Who wouldn't?
**Likes/Dislikes**: Likes candy and sugary foods; enjoys a hobby of making candy. Hates coffee. Is really into civil engineering.

#### ¶ Backstory
His twin sister Avabella was the only Hawthorne kid of their generation that matched him in intellect; prodigal twins, of equal level. Each displayed an affinity for magic early on, Logan to electricity and Ava to fire. 
What Logan also displayed was an uncanny skill of perception. Sometimes he bordered on clairvoyant, knowing things he had no business knowing: It would be years until it could be explained, by Logan himself.
After evaluation at the age of 9, the clan described his sensory talent as a "once in a generation" ability. So acute was his ability to feel magic, he could feel the residue of a mage's presence in an area, five hours after they left; without sensory training.

He enrolled at DFMA at the age of 17: At 24, he graduated from a dual degree program with a Bachelor's in the Combat Prowess Program and a PHD in Runic System Theory. His professors, on some occasions, urged him to "take it easy," something which seemed ridiculous to him at the time. 
In the present, he kinda wishes he had, but it's not that big of a deal.
Soon after graduating, in AE694 he joined the ATDF. 

Soon afterward he transferred to a Diagonal which had jurisdiction over the cultural region of Acuria, for a particular reason: He'd heard of a particular mystic group, through the grapevine; rumor said they could rewire the senses.
It was fascinating enough that he had to investigate. He spent several years in the region — This is how he learned the *One True Sense* technique — before he transferred back to Dragonfall in AE702 as a Knight under Alessia Gataki. This was 7 years before Ignis Alston's attack on Dragonfall.

Logan remembers exactly where he was that day. 


### ✦ Magic Name: Gulthan Ūle
Overall place in type triad: Defense 
Elemental Properties: Lightning, Psychic
#### ¶ Description
Logan's expertise in Runic systems, namely Sadyarushk, is one of his greatest assets as a Rook. Theoretically, if left to his devices for long enough, Logan could create a runic matrix to solve any situation; in reality, not so much.
*One True Sense* and his runic expertise mesh together exceptionally well, allowing him to discern the functionality of enemy enchantments so as to counter them. 
His defensive capabilities, combined with his enhanced mobility, enable him to make sure everyone comes home alive.
#### ¶ Techniques
**» One True Sense** (Self, Passive || N/E)
> Logan has rewired his brain through extensive training and effort. The barriers between his senses have been broken, allowing them to overlap, combine, and even strengthen each other. This includes the five senses everyone knows as well as magic sensing, but also lesser known ones.
> A far more comprehensive perception of his surroundings is the end result. It may seem, to the outside observer, that Logan can see in all directions and even through walls but it's more complicated (and less extreme) than that.
> ­
> Kinaesthesia and balance are amplified, making Logan far more resilient to disorienting spells. His acute magic senses overlap and amplify almost everything. Hearing, sight, pallesthesia (vibration sense), thermosensation, all combine and amplify the others.
> Not only does this combining strengthen each pathway of his perception, if an offensive spell closes off one of those pathways, Logan can continue on almost entirely unhindered.
> $\quad$­
> **µ Inborn Extrasensory Gift** (Self, Passive || N/E)
>> From childhood, Logan has always seemed to know things he shouldn't. That's because, from childhood, he's always had an extremely acute ability to sense magic. So acute in fact that he knew his older cousin, Simon Hawthorne, was going to experience heart failure over a year before it happened.
>> Nobody believed him.
>>  His extrasensory gift has only grown stronger with time and training. Now, if he knows the signature of a mage, he can pinpoint their exact location relative to him if they're uncloaked within 100 meters. Logan can also track magi through the magic residue their presence leaves behind.

**» Psioelectric Discipline** (Self || Lightning, Psychic)
> Logan's lightning manipulation has been supercharged by his psychic talent and vice versa; the two have fused beyond separation. His Psioelectric control extends in a 5m radius circle around him, growing to 8m when he holds Bealkada or Thundael. He can grab objects and people with psychic-lightning appendages which sprout from his body; he controls whether they electrocute the held object. Another technique available to him is, of course, shooting electricity from his body and his weapons which has an increased range of 7m, or 14m with one of his swords.
> If he has the time to do so, he can focus and use himself as a capacitor for his lightning magic. He can move and fight physically while doing so, but cannot use other magic. This is called Capacitance. For every turn he does this, his next ability will have increased power and 1m range for every turn; after five turns, at which he will begin to spark and radiate electricity, his next attack will gain an additional 5m range — on top of the 5m previously granted by Capacitance — and the **Bunker Buster** effect, making it exceptionally effective against both arcane and physical defenses. The benefits of each turn focused decrease after the fifth. 
> After a Capacitance attack is used, Capacitance cannot begin again for 4 turns.
$\quad$
> **µ Friction Control** (Self || Psy, Lightning)
>> Allows Logan to control his friction with any and every surface individually. He can disable all friction with the ground while increasing friction with his sword, making it impossible for it to be knocked from his grasp. Thanks to ceaseless practice, this technique uses little mana.
>> Friction Control enabled Logan to move and reposition in ways that look comical, but are dangerously effective.
$\quad$
> **µ Cicruit Break Riposte** (Defense || Psy, Lightning)
>> Logan creates an electric circuit between him and his blade before taking up a defensive stance. When blocking an attack while Circuit Break is active, the electric circuit is disturbed. Logan must initiate Circuit Break one turn before it activates, and can maintain this defensive stance for up to two turns.
>> When combined with his One True Sense, Circuit Break allows him to block and then riposte *instantly.* A secondary effect is that, on initial success, Circuit Break can repeatedly chain into itself within the same turn allowing Logan to block a flurry of many attacks (like a hail of arrows or other projectiles) and immediately follow up.
>$\quad$
> **µ Revolution** (Defense || Psy, Lightning)
>> Revolution is Logan's most powerful on-the-spot defensive ability. The following steps happen very, very rapidly: Logan first seals his magic inside his body, puts it under pressure, before he begins to spin and release it from everywhere on his body at once. This makes him spin much, much faster. 
>> In fractions of a second, a shell of violently rotating psioelectric magic forms around Logan. This shell has a diameter of 7 meters around Logan. This shell is not only incredibly hard to pierce, it will (try to) shred anything which touches it. In turn, Logan cannot maintain it for long; using it for 4 turns would consume half of his maximum mana supply.

**» Bunker Charms** (Defense || Psy, Lightning) 
> Logan has several techniques in his arsenal under this umbrella term. All of them use rune matrices in some way. 
> The first and simplest of these is "Thundael Protects" —
> Logan points Thundael forward and channels his psionic might through the blade, while simultaneously, a well memorized runic circle is carved into the air. A concave circular shield is created from the blades tip. 
> Thundael as a catalyst and the stance of pointing it forward as a somatic component are the only requirements. While it is incredibly quick to engage and cheap to use, it is not notably powerful.
> $\quad$
> **µ Nexal Reinforcement** (Defense || Psy, Lightning)
>> Logan can reinforce pre-existing structures by applying to it a rune matrix with a diameter the size of his fully spread hand. Logan must keep his hand on the structure for 6 turns to do so, as the matrix is incredibly dense. Cost scales with strength. While it can technically endure for a very long time, it cannot be recharged and only has a certain storage capacity. This is most effective against energy-based attacks, allowing structures (like critical infrastructure) to endure an attack that would actually just vaporize them.
>> These nexus points can be connected in series, with a range of 30m between points, allowing Logan to create a series of reinforced buildings. This **Nexal Reinforcement Series** gets slightly stronger with each added nexus point. If he wants to remain combat ready, he can only make one of these a day. 

**» Ward Creation** (Defense || Psy, Lightning)
> Logan draws a runic circle in the air around an intended, usually friendly, target. A singular damage type to be protected against is specified, and an amount of mana is allocated to the spell. Then the Ward is finished.
> Wards act as shields with a battery, that being the amount of mana allocated to them, against the specified damage type. They can be visualized as a bubble closely hugging the body of the target, absorbing attacks of the specified type and consuming mana from their battery to do so. The ward can block anywhere between 1-8 attacks, depending on attack strength and the power allotted to the ward, before unravelling and ceasing to exist.
> Available damage types: Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing. Requires the target to remain within five meters of Logan for three turns.
### ✦ Gear
#### ¶ Bealkadā
Elemental properties: **Psy, Lightning**
Catalyst: **Y**
##### µ Physical Description
Logan's Montante Bealkadā has an overall length of 66" and a blade length of 50". The long crossguard is not accompanied by side rings as he's found they get in his way far more than they're worth. Above the crossguard is the ricasso. The ricasso is an unsharpened portion of the blade handled during halfswording, and is protected by parrying hooks, effectively a smaller crossguard. 

The most striking aspect of the Montante is the blade. The metal is the purest white, like ivory. 

##### µ Functional Description
Bealkadā's creation was a joint effort between the Hawthorne family and Blaise Corbin. The weapon, from before creation, has been fully saturated with Logan's magic. He is able to call it to his side regardless of distance, so long as it has a viable path to get to him. Logan also has a general sense of where Bealkadā is at all times, again regardless of distance. 

#### ¶ Thundael 
Elemental properties: **Psy, Lightning**
Catalyst: **Y**

##### µ Physical Description
Logan's sidearm Thundael, a bastard sword. It has an overall length of 49" and a blade length of 38". Unlike Bealkadā, the crossguard is accompanied by side rings. However, like Bealkadā, Thundael's blade is the purest ivory white.

##### µ Functional Description
Thundael's creation mirrors that of its twin sister. Like his montante, Logan can call it to his side from any distance and tell where it is at all times.
