As an Akerr Drake, Bok'uo has three pairs of limbs: hind legs; multifunctional forelimbs, which can work as arms or legs; and then slightly smaller, more dexterous arms situated just behind the forelimbs. Head clearance permitting, he can walk on two legs or four as he pleases.
Neck length in Akerr Drakes is not so excessive as some classes of dragons; the proportion to the rest of the body lies somewhere between a wolf's and a horse's. Horns are common features, but Bok'uo himself has none.

### ✦ Info

Personality: Bok'uo is quite head strong, for better or worse, in *every* situation. He's got a strong, firm spirit. That means he's very determined and doesn't give up easy, even if he's wrong. At the same time, he's insecure, and often does the mental equivalent of pacing in circles around an issue, passing right by other possible solutions and ending right back where he started.
Likes/Dislikes: Wants to be an architect, has interests in Landscape Architecture, Civil Engineering, design, and planning. Likes sleep and coffee, dislikes conflict.

#### ¶ Backstory
Bok'uo was born and raised on the great dry plains of Akeraan's Mezma, in a small little town sitting at the foot of the Drirka mountain range. His dad was never in the picture; mom never liked to talk about it. He still doesn't think he ever got the full story from her. 
It was just him, mom, and his two younger brothers.
So, when his magic started to rear its head, he knew what kind of thing he'd been given. As the only mage in his family, he had a responsibility to follow this opportunity - that being, the magic he's been given - through to the end; for his family, yes, but also for himself. 
How could he possibly live with himself, if he squandered this?
With that in mind, knowing the prestige of Dragonfall, he knew where he wanted to transfer once he had saved up enough.

### Magic Name: Umfundi Zahlabathi
Overall place in type triad: Support
Elemental Properties: Earth (Metal), Psychic
#### Description
Bok'uo makes usage of prayer beads, taking inspiration from Tiwonge, a "Saint" of pre-empire Akerr history. The story goes he was a builder of many great works, prior to the existence of the Zulthanian Empire, but most that is known of him today is relegated to myth and legend. 
Bok'uo's magic is geared toward architecture and not combat; it's been his dream and his goal since he was just a boy, even before **Ukukonda** revealed itself.
#### Techniques
**» Ukukonda** (Passive || Psychic, Earth)
> Through physical contact, Bok'uo can understand basic details on the composition and construction of small to medium-sized buildings. The name of this seismic-sense adjacent ability translates as "To understand."
> This works on the majority of mundane items, including the ground, allowing him to understand the composition of a small area underneath his feet. 
> This ability, present from birth, enables Bok'uo to feel any faults or damage in buildings or structures around him, including *how* exactly they're going to fail. He is also able to feel magical disturbances in the ground or in structures around him.
> **µ Enzekatha** (Support || Psychic, Earth)
>> Bok'uo can reinforce pre-existing structures or items with Earth magic within a 5 meter radius, enhancing durability and physical defense. This cannot affect living things. The effects of Enzekatha last for 4 turns, but with extra energy can last for 6 turns. 

**» Shukumlabathi** (Self || Earth & Metal)
> Bok'uo has, over time, developed the ability to manipulate soil, rock, and metal in a short (2m) radius around him. This ability is very short ranged, but has ample dexterity to it; particularly when shaping metal. He is able to bend, separate, and mend metal so finely that the joining cannot be detected through most means.
### Gear
##### ¶ Prayer Beads
Elemental Properties: Earth
Catalyst: Y
###### µ Description
Bok'uo's Mala has 111 beads, 108 primary with three "counter" beads used for keeping track. The beads themselves are made of sandalwood, bound on a cotton string. The usage of his Mala boosts Bok'uo's concentration considerably, allowing him to shape earth and metal much more delicately.
