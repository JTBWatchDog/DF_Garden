### ✦ Magic Name: Wrath of The World
Overall place in type triad: Offense 
Elemental Properties: Strength(Earth), Speed(Water)
> [!example]- Racial Perk: Dorraul Markana
>$\quad$Adalyne's arcane tattoos. Kobold magi of several specific species can be born with them. They are a direct interface between magic and biology, developing with the mage throughout life. These markings have a metallic appearance.
>
>$\quad$Adalyne has exceedingly large markana, covering extensive portions of her arms, legs, and collarbone. The markings on her arms consist of red spirals with black outlines, with a white cross on the outside of her right forearm; on her legs, interwoven emerald green bands with black outlines. The last, on her collarbone, is defined by thin flowing black bands that meet at her sternum; in the middle of them, over her sternum, there is a small portion of Adalyne's flesh that has crystallized.
#### ¶ Description
Adalyne's two cloaks or "states" form the foundation of her magic and combat. She's spent 15 years shaking off rust from her retirement, bringing her (very nearly) back to her prime years prior to the founding of the ATDF. 
Changing cloaks is instantaneous, but incurs a 6 turn cool-down. This is also a "ramp up" period: Both cloaks, when activated, require 4 turns to reach full strength. 
Changing cloaks disables ongoing spells reliant on that cloak, in most cases.

It should be noted, Adalyne's manifestations of **Strength** and **Speed** require **pre-existing** physical medium to exist: Techniques such as magic constructs are impossible.

> [!EXAMPLE]- On the Design of the Twins
> The Twins, Artem and Ilya, are a pair of familiars uniquely bound to Adalyne. Their spirits fractured off from her soul sometime during her depressive episode, following Absalem's death. Being spirits of **Strength** and **Speed** which cannot exist without pre-existing physical medium, they had no physical form of their own and had to have bodies built for them.
> Their bodies are made from a Catalystic variant of Damascus steel, crafted with the bone ash of a direwolf. They each have a shoulder height of 40" and a body length of 70".
> When not active, their physical bodies are stored inside their respective Markana: Artem in the Red Markana on her arms, and Ilya in the Green Markana on Adalyne's legs.
> Both familiars have their own Health pools; when defeated, they are reverse-summoned back into their respective Markana. Adalyne will lose access to the respective element for 12 turns.

#### ¶ Techniques
**» Strength Cloak** (Self || Strength) **2 Slots**
> Adalyne is engulfed in a scarlet, flamelike aura flecked with golden embers, extending 2-3 inches from her body. This aura is purely visual. No physical effect on surroundings is present, but it is warm to the touch. 
> She has perfected, and acclimated to, the elevated state: she can maintain **Strength Cloak** indefinitely without any loss in stamina.
> $\quad$
> Her physical strength and durability in this state cannot be overstated. Her best deadlift using **Strength Cloak** currently stands at 881kg. Adalyne *can* move quickly in a straight line, however due to the increase in muscle mass mobility is generally decreased.
> **µ Subjugation** (Hex || Strength)
>> Adalyne strikes down with her poleaxe and channels **Strength** into the ground. At once, four small rocks are imbued with the element and rise into the air, and float idly around her. These projectiles deal minimal damage, but inflict the **Subjugation** hex on contact. They have two methods for usage.
>> Adalyne has the ability to simply hit one with her poleaxe to send it flying at an enemy. However she can "lock onto" an enemy to turn it into a homing projectile by focusing on them and maintaining line-of-sight for three turns; once locked on and fired it cannot be avoided, only destroyed.
>> **Subjugation** lasts for 8 turns. The hex debuffs movement-focused techniques substantially, and disables flying abilities if present; gliding at reduced speeds may be possible. Once used, **Subjugation** cannot be cast again for 12 turns. 
>> Active projectiles become inert if **Strength Cloak** is deactivated; the hex, if already inflicted, will continue for its usual duration.

**» Artem** (Familiar || Strength) 
> Artem is the avatar of Adalyne's **Strength**. When Artem is summoned, Adalyne loses access to **Strength**, and thus all spells requiring it. Tanky, tail can transform into a giant fucking hand. Eats damage, then is reverse summoned to regain health. Regains health faster than Ilya.

**» Speed Cloak** (Self || Speed) **2 Slots**
> The physical appearance is identical to **Strength Cloak**, only it is verdant instead of scarlet. Also unlike **Strength Cloak**, it cannot be maintained indefinitely without loss in stamina.
> $\quad$
> The effect is also like the other, only while **Speed Cloak** is active, Adalyne can move at high speeds while maintaining extreme mobility. She is able to navigate tight passageways, such as alleys, and make sharp turns without slowing down. Adalyne can run 1500 meters in 0:29.55 while in **Speed Cloak**.

**» Ilya** (Familiar || Speed)
> Ilya is the avatar of Adalyne's **Speed**; when summoned, she loses access to it and all spells requiring it. Herds the enemy by poking them, but very squishy.
