Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I use this as a personal repository for all my writing big & small. Eventually there'll be more info here, but if you're seeing this, you're probably someone I know & you can just ask me for context.

- DFMA - Writing for a roleplay server I'm in, modern fantasy setting centered around a college-esque mage academy
- NewFaith - Writing for a Cult of the Lamb fic
- Tree of Life - Writing for a Naruto fic
